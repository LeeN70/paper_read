Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pretrain deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fne-i tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial taskspecifc architecture modifcations.ii\n\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful.It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement),MultiNLI accuracy to $86.7\\%$ (4 $.6\\%$ absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1(5.1 point absolute improvement).\n\n## 1Introduction\n\nLanguage model pre-training has been shown to be effective for improving many natural language processing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder,2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as natural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;Williams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan and Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the relationships between sentences by analyzing them holistically, as well as token-level tasks such as named entity recognition and question answering,where models are required to produce fne-grainedi output at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).\n\nThere are two existing strategies for applying pre-trained language representations to downstream tasks: feature-based and fne-tuning. Thei feature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters et al., 2018a), uses task-specifc architectures thati include the pre-trained representations as additional features. The fne-tuning approach, such asi the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI GPT) (Radford et al., 2018), introduces minimal task-specifc parameters, and is trained on thei downstream tasks by simply fne-tuningi $all$ pretrained parameters. The two approaches share the same objective function during pre-training, where they use unidirectional language models to learn general language representations.\n\nWe argue that current techniques restrict the power of the pre-trained representations, especially for the fne-tuning approaches.The ma-i jor limitation is that standard language models are unidirectional, and this limits the choice of architectures that can be used during pre-training. For example, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-toright architecture, where every token can only attend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers of the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Such restrictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks,and could be very harmful when applying fne-i tuning based approaches to token-level tasks such as question answering, where it is crucial to incorporate context from both directions.\n\nIn this paper, we improve the fne-tuning basedi approaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional EncoderRepresentationsfromTransformers.BERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidirectionality constraint by using a “masked language model” (MLM) pre-training objective, inspired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953).The masked language model randomly masks some of the tokens from the input, and the objective is to predict the original vocabulary id of the maskedword based only on its context.Unlike left-toright language model pre-training, the MLM objective enables the representation to fuse the left and the right context, which allows us to pretrain a deep bidirectional Transformer. In addition to the masked language model, we also use a “next sentence prediction” task that jointly pretrains text-pair representations. The contributions of our paper are as follows:\n\nWe demonstrate the importance of bidirectional pre-training for language representations. Unlike Radford et al. (2018), which uses unidirectional language models for pre-training, BERT uses masked language models to enable pretrained deep bidirectional representations. This is also in contrast to Peters et al. (2018a), which uses a shallow concatenation of independently trained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs.\n\nWe show that pre-trained representations reduce the need for many heavily-engineered taskspecifc architectures. BERT is the frst fne-iii tuning based representation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on a large suite of sentence-level and token-level tasks, outperforming many task-specifc architectures.i\n\nBERT advances the state of the art for eleven NLP tasks.The code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/google-research/bert.\n\n## 2Related Work\n\nThere is a long history of pre-training general language representations, and we briefy review thel most widely-used approaches in this section.\n\n## 2.1Unsupervised Feature-based Approaches\n\nLearning widely applicable representations of words has been an active area of research for decades, including non-neural (Brown et al., 1992;Ando and Zhang, 2005; Blitzer et al., 2006) and neural (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al.,2014) methods.Pre-trained word embeddings are an integral part of modern NLP systems, offering signifcant improvements over embeddingsi learned from scratch (Turian et al., 2010). To pretrain word embedding vectors, left-to-right language modeling objectives have been used (Mnih and Hinton, 2009), as well as objectives to discriminate correct from incorrect words in left and right context (Mikolov et al., 2013).\n\nThese approaches have been generalized to coarser granularities, such as sentence embeddings (Kiros et al., 2015; Logeswaran and Lee,2018) or paragraph embeddings (Le and Mikolov,2014).To train sentence representations, prior work has used objectives to rank candidate next sentences (Jernite et al., 2017; Logeswaran and Lee, 2018), left-to-right generation of next sentence words given a representation of the previous sentence (Kiros et al., 2015), or denoising autoencoder derived objectives (Hill et al., 2016).\n\nELMo and its predecessor (Peters et al., 2017,2018a) generalize traditional word embedding research along a different dimension. They extract context-sensitive features from a left-to-right and a right-to-left language model. The contextual representation of each token is the concatenation of the left-to-right and right-to-left representations.When integrating contextual word embeddings with existing task-specifc architectures, ELMoi advances the state of the art for several major NLP benchmarks (Peters et al., 2018a) including question answering (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), sentiment analysis (Socher et al., 2013), and named entity recognition (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder,2003). Melamud et al. (2016) proposed learning contextual representations through a task to predict a single word from both left and right context using LSTMs. Similar to ELMo, their model is feature-based and not deeply bidirectional. Fedus et al. (2018) shows that the cloze task can be used to improve the robustness of text generation models.\n\n## 2.2Unsupervised Fine-tuning Approaches\n\nAs with the feature-based approaches, the frsti works in this direction only pre-trained word embedding parameters from unlabeled text(Collobert and Weston, 2008).\n\nMore recently, sentence or document encoders which produce contextual token representations have been pre-trained from unlabeled text and fne-tuned for a supervised downstream task (Daii and Le, 2015; Howard and Ruder, 2018; Radford et al., 2018). The advantage of these approaches is that few parameters need to be learned from scratch.At least partly due to this advantage,OpenAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018) achieved previously state-of-the-art results on many sentencelevel tasks from the GLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2018a).Left-to-right language model-\n\n\n\n![dadd6bf767539d60c7e4d2e492cee271](imgs/dadd6bf767539d60c7e4d2e492cee271.jpg)\n\nFigure 1: Overall pre-training and fne-tuning procedures for BERT. Apart from output layers, the same architec-i tures are used in both pre-training and fne-tuning. The same pre-trained model parameters are used to initializei models for different down-stream tasks. During fne-tuning, all parameters are fne-tuned. [CLS] is a specialii symbol added in front of every input example, and [SEP] is a special separator token (e.g. separating questions/answers).\n\ning and auto-encoder objectives have been used for pre-training such models (Howard and Ruder,2018; Radford et al., 2018; Dai and Le, 2015).\n\n## 2.3Transfer Learning from Supervised Data\n\nThere has also been work showing effective transfer from supervised tasks with large datasets, such as natural language inference (Conneau et al.,2017) and machine translation (McCann et al.,2017). Computer vision research has also demonstrated the importance of transfer learning from large pre-trained models, where an effective recipe is to fne-tune models pre-trained with Ima-i geNet (Deng et al., 2009; Yosinski et al., 2014).\n\n## 3BERT\n\nWe introduce BERT and its detailed implementation in this section. There are two steps in our framework: pre-training and fne-tuning.Dur-i ing pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled data over different pre-training tasks.For fne-i tuning, the BERT model is frst initialized withi the pre-trained parameters, and all of the parameters are fne-tuned using labeled data from thei downstream tasks. Each downstream task has separate fne-tuned models, even though they are ini-i tialized with the same pre-trained parameters. The question-answering example in Figure 1 will serve as a running example for this section.\n\nA distinctive feature of BERT is its unifed ar-i chitecture across different tasks. There is mini-mal difference between the pre-trained architecture and the fnal downstream architecture.i\n\nModel ArchitectureBERT’s model architecture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer encoder based on the original implementation described in Vaswani et al. (2017) and released in the tensor2tensor library.1 Because the use of Transformers has become common and our implementation is almost identical to the original,we will omit an exhaustive background description of the model architecture and refer readers to Vaswani et al. (2017) as well as excellent guides such as “The Annotated Transformer.”2\n\nIn this work, we denote the number of layers(i.e., Transformer blocks) as $L.$  the hidden size as $H,$  and the number of self-attention heads as $A.^{3}$ We primarily report results on two model sizes:BERTBASE (L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Parameters=110M) and BERTLARGE (L=24, H=1024,A=16, Total Parameters=340M).\n\nBERTBASE was chosen to have the same model size as OpenAI GPT for comparison purposes.Critically, however, the BERT Transformer uses bidirectional self-attention, while the GPT Transformer uses constrained self-attention where every token can only attend to context to its left.4\n\n\n\nInput/Output RepresentationsTo make BERT handle a variety of down-stream tasks, our input representation is able to unambiguously represent both a single sentence and a pair of sentences(e.g., ⟨Question, Answer ⟩) in one token sequence.Throughout this work, a “sentence” can be an arbitrary span of contiguous text, rather than an actual linguistic sentence. A “sequence” refers to the input token sequence to BERT, which may be a single sentence or two sentences packed together.\n\nWe use WordPiece embeddings (Wu et al.,2016) with a 30,000 token vocabulary. The frsti token of every sequence is always a special classifcation token ([CLS]). The fnal hidden stateii corresponding to this token is used as the aggregate sequence representation for classifcationi tasks. Sentence pairs are packed together into a single sequence. We differentiate the sentences in two ways. First, we separate them with a special token ([SEP]). Second, we add a learned embedding to every token indicating whether it belongs to sentence A or sentence B. As shown in Figure 1,we denote input embedding as E, the fnal hiddeni vector of the special [CLS] token as $C \\in\\mathbb{R}^{H},$ and the fnal hidden vector for thei $i^{\\text{th}}$ input token as $T_{i} \\in\\mathbb{R}^{H}.$\n\nFor a given token, its input representation is constructed by summing the corresponding token,segment, and position embeddings. A visualization of this construction can be seen in Figure 2.\n\n## 3.1Pre-training BERT\n\nUnlike Peters et al. (2018a) and Radford et al.(2018), we do not use traditional left-to-right or right-to-left language models to pre-train BERT.Instead, we pre-train BERT using two unsupervised tasks, described in this section. This step is presented in the left part of Figure 1.\n\nTask #1: Masked LMIntuitively, it is reasonable to believe that a deep bidirectional model is strictly more powerful than either a left-to-right model or the shallow concatenation of a left-toright and a right-to-left model.Unfortunately,standard conditional language models can only be trained left-to-right $or$ right-to-left, since bidirectional conditioning would allow each word to indirectly “see itself”, and the model could trivially predict the target word in a multi-layered context.\n\nIn order to train a deep bidirectional representation, we simply mask some percentage of the input tokens at random, and then predict those masked tokens. We refer to this procedure as a “masked LM” (MLM), although it is often referred to as a Cloze task in the literature (Taylor, 1953). In this case, the fnal hidden vectors corresponding to thei mask tokens are fed into an output softmax over the vocabulary, as in a standard LM. In all of our experiments, we mask $15\\%$ of all WordPiece tokens in each sequence at random. In contrast to denoising auto-encoders (Vincent et al., 2008), we only predict the masked words rather than reconstructing the entire input.\n\nAlthough this allows us to obtain a bidirectional pre-trained model, a downside is that we are creating a mismatch between pre-training and fne-tuning, since the [MASK] token does not ap-i pear during fne-tuning. To mitigate this, we doi not always replace “masked” words with the actual [MASK] token. The training data generator chooses $15\\%$  of the token positions at random for prediction. If the $i$ th token is chosen, we replace the $i$ th token with (1) the [MASK] token $80\\%$ of the time (2) a random token $10\\%$  of the time (3)the unchanged $i$ -th token $10\\%$ of the time. Then, $T_{i}$  will be used to predict the original token with cross entropy loss. We compare variations of this procedure in Appendix C.2.\n\nTask #2:Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)Many important downstream tasks such as Question Answering (QA) and Natural Language Inference (NLI) are based on understanding the relationship between two sentences, which is not directly captured by language modeling. In order to train a model that understands sentence relationships, we pre-train for a binarized next sentence prediction task that can be trivially generated from any monolingual corpus. Specifcally,i when choosing the sentences $A$  and B for each pretraining example, $50\\%$ of the time B is the actual next sentence that follows A (labeled as IsNext),and $50\\%$  of the time it is a random sentence from the corpus (labeled as NotNext).As we show in Figure 1, $C$ is used for next sentence prediction (NSP).5 Despite its simplicity, we demonstrate in Section 5.1 that pre-training towards this task is very benefcial to both QA and NLI. 6i\n\n\n\n![bbb306df50ffc97d4f26fcbe08ccb812](imgs/bbb306df50ffc97d4f26fcbe08ccb812.jpg)\n\nFigure 2: BERT input representation. The input embeddings are the sum of the token embeddings, the segmentation embeddings and the position embeddings.\n\nThe NSP task is closely related to representationlearning objectives used in Jernite et al. (2017) and Logeswaran and Lee (2018). However, in prior work, only sentence embeddings are transferred to down-stream tasks, where BERT transfers all parameters to initialize end-task model parameters.\n\nPre-training data The pre-training procedure largely follows the existing literature on language model pre-training. For the pre-training corpus we use the BooksCorpus (800M words) (Zhu et al.,2015) and English Wikipedia (2,500M words).For Wikipedia we extract only the text passages and ignore lists, tables, and headers. It is critical to use a document-level corpus rather than a shuffed sentence-level corpus such as the Billionl Word Benchmark (Chelba et al., 2013) in order to extract long contiguous sequences.\n\n## 3.2Fine-tuning BERT\n\nFine-tuning is straightforward since the selfattention mechanism in the Transformer allows BERT to model many downstream tasks—whether they involve single text or text pairs—by swapping out the appropriate inputs and outputs.For applications involving text pairs, a common pattern is to independently encode text pairs before applying bidirectional cross attention, such as Parikh et al. (2016); Seo et al. (2017). BERT instead uses the self-attention mechanism to unify these two stages, as encoding a concatenated text pair with self-attention effectively includes bidirectional cross attention between two sentences.\n\nFor each task, we simply plug in the taskspecifc inputs and outputs into BERT and fne-ii tune all the parameters end-to-end.At the input, sentence A and sentence B from pre-training are analogous to (1) sentence pairs in paraphrasing, (2) hypothesis-premise pairs in entailment, (3)question-passage pairs in question answering, and(4) a degenerate text- $\\varnothing$ pair in text classifcationi or sequence tagging. At the output, the token representations are fed into an output layer for tokenlevel tasks, such as sequence tagging or question answering, and the [CLS] representation is fed into an output layer for classifcation, such as en-i tailment or sentiment analysis.\n\nCompared to pre-training, fne-tuning is rela-i tively inexpensive. All of the results in the paper can be replicated in at most 1 hour on a single Cloud TPU, or a few hours on a GPU, starting from the exact same pre-trained model.7 We describe the task-specifc details in the correspond-i ing subsections of Section 4. More details can be found in Appendix A.5.\n\n## 4Experiments\n\nIn this section, we present BERT fne-tuning re-i sults on 11 NLP tasks.\n\n## 4.1GLUE\n\nThe General Language Understanding Evaluation(GLUE) benchmark (Wang et al., 2018a) is a collection of diverse natural language understanding tasks. Detailed descriptions of GLUE datasets are included in Appendix B.1.\n\nTo fne-tune on GLUE, we represent the inputi sequence (for single sentence or sentence pairs)as described in Section 3, and use the fnal hid-i den vector $C\\ \\in\\ \\mathbb{R}^{H}$ corresponding to the frsti input token ([CLS]) as the aggregate representation. The only new parameters introduced during fne-tuning are classifcation layer weightsii $W \\in$  $\\mathbb{R}^{K\\times H},$  where $K$  is the number of labels. We com- pute a standard classifcation loss withi $C$ and W, i.e., $\\log(\\text{softmax}(CW^{T})).$\n\n\n\n\n\n<html><body><table><thead><tr><td>System</td><td>MNLI-(m/mm) 392k</td><td>QQP 363k</td><td>QNLI 108k</td><td>SST-2 67k</td><td>CoLA 8.5k</td><td>STS-B 5.7k</td><td>MRPC 3.5k</td><td>RTE 2.5k</td><td>Average -</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Pre-OpenAI SOTA</td><td>80.6/80.1</td><td>66.1</td><td>82.3</td><td>93.2</td><td>35.0</td><td>81.0</td><td>86.0</td><td>61.7</td><td>74.0</td></tr><tr><td>BiLSTM+ELMo+Attn</td><td>76.4/76.1</td><td>64.8</td><td>79.8</td><td>90.4</td><td>36.0</td><td>73.3</td><td>84.9</td><td>56.8</td><td>71.0</td></tr><tr><td>OpenAI GPT</td><td>82.1/81.4</td><td>70.3</td><td>87.4</td><td>91.3</td><td>45.4</td><td>80.0</td><td>82.3</td><td>56.0</td><td>75.1</td></tr><tr><td>BERTBASE</td><td>84.6/83.4</td><td>71.2</td><td>90.5</td><td>93.5</td><td>52.1</td><td>85.8</td><td>88.9</td><td>66.4</td><td>79.6</td></tr><tr><td>BERTLARGE</td><td>86.7/85.9</td><td>72.1</td><td>92.7</td><td>94.9</td><td>60.5</td><td>86.5</td><td>89.3</td><td>70.1</td><td>82.1</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>\n\nTable 1: GLUE Test results, scored by the evaluation server (https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard).The number below each task denotes the number of training examples. The “Average” column is slightly different than the offcial GLUE score, since we exclude the problematic WNLI set.8 BERT and OpenAI GPT are single-i model, single task. F1 scores are reported for QQP and MRPC, Spearman correlations are reported for STS-B, and accuracy scores are reported for the other tasks. We exclude entries that use BERT as one of their components.\n\nWe use a batch size of 32 and fne-tune for 3i epochs over the data for all GLUE tasks. For each task, we selected the best fne-tuning learning ratei(among 5e-5, 4e-5, 3e-5, and 2e-5) on the Dev set.Additionally, for BERTLARGE we found that fne-i tuning was sometimes unstable on small datasets,so we ran several random restarts and selected the best model on the Dev set. With random restarts,we use the same pre-trained checkpoint but perform different fne-tuning data shuffing and clas-il sifer layer initialization.9i\n\nResults are presented in Table 1.Both BERTBASE and BERTLARGE outperform all systems on all tasks by a substantial margin, obtaining $4.5\\%$ and $7.0\\%$ respective average accuracy im- provement over the prior state of the art. Note that BERTBASE and OpenAI GPT are nearly identical in terms of model architecture apart from the attention masking. For the largest and most widely reported GLUE task, MNLI, BERT obtains a $4.6\\%$ absolute accuracy improvement. On the offciali GLUE leaderboard10, BERTLARGE obtains a score of 80.5, compared to OpenAI GPT, which obtains 72.8 as of the date of writing.\n\nWe fnd that BERTLARGE signifcantly outper-ii forms BERTBASE across all tasks, especially those with very little training data. The effect of model size is explored more thoroughly in Section 5.2.\n\n## 4.2SQuAD v1.1\n\nTheStanfordQuestionAnsweringDataset(SQuAD v1.1) is a collection of 100k crowdsourced question/answer pairs (Rajpurkar et al.,2016).Given a question and a passage fromWikipedia containing the answer, the task is to predict the answer text span in the passage.\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, in the question answering task, we represent the input question and passage as a single packed sequence, with the question using the A embedding and the passage using the B embedding. We only introduce a start vector $S \\in\\mathbb{R}^{H}$ and an end vector $E \\in\\mathbb{R}^{H}$ during fne-tuning. The probability of wordi $i$  being the start of the answer span is computed as a dot product between $T_{i}$ and $S$  followed by a softmax over all of the words in the paragraph: $P_{i}=\\tfrac{e^{S\\cdot T_{i}}}{\\sum_{j}e^{S\\cdot T_{j}}}.$ The analogous formula is used for the end of the answer span. The score of a candidate span from position $i$  to position j is defned asi $S\\cdot T_{i}+E\\cdot T_{j},$ and the maximum scoring span where $j \\geq i$  is used as a prediction. The training objective is the sum of the log-likelihoods of the correct start and end positions. We fne-tune for 3 epochs with ai learning rate of 5e-5 and a batch size of 32.\n\nTable 2 shows top leaderboard entries as well as results from top published systems (Seo et al.,2017; Clark and Gardner, 2018; Peters et al.,2018a; Hu et al., 2018). The top results from the SQuAD leaderboard do not have up-to-date public system descriptions available,11 and are allowed to use any public data when training their systems.We therefore use modest data augmentation in our system by frst fne-tuning on TriviaQA (Joshiii et al., 2017) befor fne-tuning on SQuAD.i\n\nOur best performing system outperforms the top leaderboard system by $+1.5$  F1 in ensembling and+1.3 F1 as a single system. In fact, our single BERT model outperforms the top ensemble system in terms of F1 score.

The only task-specifc parameters introduced is a vec-i tor whose dot product with the [CLS] token representation $C$ denotes a score for each choice which is normalized with a softmax layer.\n\nWe fne-tune the model for 3 epochs with ai learning rate of 2e-5 and a batch size of 16. Results are presented in Table 4. BERTLARGE outperforms the authors’ baseline ESIM+ELMo sys- tem by $+27.1\\%$ and OpenAI GPT by $8.3\\%.$\n\n## 5Ablation Studies\n\nIn this section, we perform ablation experiments over a number of facets of BERT in order to better understand their relative importance. Additional\n\n\n\n\n\n<html><body><table><thead><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"5\">Dev Set</td></tr><tr><td>Tasks</td><td>MNLI-m (Acc)</td><td>QNLI (Acc)</td><td>MRPC (Acc)</td><td> SST-2 (Acc)</td><td> SQuAD (F1)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>BERTBASE</td><td>84.4</td><td>88.4</td><td>86.7</td><td>92.7</td><td>88.5</td></tr><tr><td>No NSP</td><td>83.9</td><td>84.9</td><td>86.5</td><td>92.6</td><td>87.9</td></tr><tr><td>LTR & No NSP</td><td>82.1</td><td>84.3</td><td>77.5</td><td>92.1</td><td>77.8</td></tr><tr><td>+ BiLSTM</td><td>82.1</td><td>84.1</td><td>75.7</td><td>91.6</td><td>84.9</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>\n\nTable 5: Ablation over the pre-training tasks using the BERTBASE architecture. “No NSP” is trained without the next sentence prediction task. “LTR & No NSP” is trained as a left-to-right LM without the next sentence prediction, like OpenAI GPT. “+ BiLSTM” adds a randomly initialized BiLSTM on top of the “LTR + No NSP” model during fne-tuning.i\n\nablation studies can be found in Appendix C.\n\n## 5.1Effect of Pre-training Tasks\n\nWe demonstrate the importance of the deep bidirectionality of BERT by evaluating two pretraining objectives using exactly the same pretraining data, fne-tuning scheme, and hyperpa-i rameters as BERTBASE:\n\nNo NSP: A bidirectional model which is trained using the “masked LM” (MLM) but without the“next sentence prediction” (NSP) task.\n\nLTR & No NSP: A left-context-only model which is trained using a standard Left-to-Right (LTR)LM, rather than an MLM. The left-only constraint was also applied at fne-tuning, because removingi it introduced a pre-train/fne-tune mismatch thati degraded downstream performance. Additionally,this model was pre-trained without the NSP task.This is directly comparable to OpenAI GPT, but using our larger training dataset, our input representation, and our fne-tuning scheme.i\n\nWe frst examine the impact brought by the NSPi task.In Table 5, we show that removing NSP hurts performance signifcantly on QNLI, MNLI,i and SQuAD 1.1. Next, we evaluate the impact of training bidirectional representations by comparing “No NSP” to “LTR & No NSP”. The LTR model performs worse than the MLM model on all tasks, with large drops on MRPC and SQuAD.\n\nFor SQuAD it is intuitively clear that a LTR model will perform poorly at token predictions,since the token-level hidden states have no rightside context. In order to make a good faith attempt at strengthening the LTR system, we added a randomly initialized BiLSTM on top. This does signifcantly improve results on SQuAD, but theiresults are still far worse than those of the pretrained bidirectional models. The BiLSTM hurts performance on the GLUE tasks.\n\nWe recognize that it would also be possible to train separate LTR and RTL models and represent each token as the concatenation of the two models, as ELMo does. However: (a) this is twice as expensive as a single bidirectional model; (b) this is non-intuitive for tasks like QA, since the RTL model would not be able to condition the answer on the question; (c) this it is strictly less powerful than a deep bidirectional model, since it can use both left and right context at every layer.\n\n## 5.2Effect of Model Size\n\nIn this section, we explore the effect of model size on fne-tuning task accuracy. We trained a numberi of BERT models with a differing number of layers,hidden units, and attention heads, while otherwise using the same hyperparameters and training procedure as described previously.\n\nResults on selected GLUE tasks are shown in Table 6. In this table, we report the average Dev Set accuracy from 5 random restarts of fne-tuning.i We can see that larger models lead to a strict accuracy improvement across all four datasets, even for MRPC which only has 3,600 labeled training examples, and is substantially different from the pre-training tasks. It is also perhaps surprising that we are able to achieve such signifcanti improvements on top of models which are already quite large relative to the existing literature.For example, the largest Transformer explored in Vaswani et al. (2017) is (L=6, H=1024, A=16)with 100M parameters for the encoder, and the largest Transformer we have found in the literature is (L=64, H=512, A=2) with 235M parameters(Al-Rfou et al., 2018). By contrast, BERTBASE contains 110M parameters and BERTLARGE contains 340M parameters.\n\nIt has long been known that increasing the model size will lead to continual improvements on large-scale tasks such as machine translation and language modeling, which is demonstrated by the LM perplexity of held-out training data shown in Table 6.However, we believe that this is the frst work to demonstrate convinc-i ingly that scaling to extreme model sizes also leads to large improvements on very small scale tasks, provided that the model has been suff-i ciently pre-trained. Peters et al. (2018b) presentedmixed results on the downstream task impact of increasing the pre-trained bi-LM size from two to four layers and Melamud et al. (2016) mentioned in passing that increasing hidden dimension size from 200 to 600 helped, but increasing further to 1,000 did not bring further improvements. Both of these prior works used a featurebased approach — we hypothesize that when the model is fne-tuned directly on the downstreami tasks and uses only a very small number of randomly initialized additional parameters, the taskspecifc models can beneft from the larger, moreii expressive pre-trained representations even when downstream task data is very small.\n\n## 5.3Feature-based Approach with BERT\n\nAll of the BERT results presented so far have used the fne-tuning approach, where a simple classif-ii cation layer is added to the pre-trained model, and all parameters are jointly fne-tuned on a down-i stream task. However, the feature-based approach,where fxed features are extracted from the pre-i trained model, has certain advantages. First, not all tasks can be easily represented by a Transformer encoder architecture, and therefore require a task-specifc model architecture to be added.i Second, there are major computational beneftsi to pre-compute an expensive representation of the training data once and then run many experiments with cheaper models on top of this representation.\n\nIn this section, we compare the two approaches by applying BERT to the CoNLL-2003 Named Entity Recognition (NER) task (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003). In the input to BERT, we use a case-preserving WordPiece model, and we include the maximal document context provided by the data. Following standard practice, we formulate this as a tagging task but do not use a CRF\n\n\n\n<html><body><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Hyperparams</td><td colspan=\"3\">Dev Set Accuracy</td></tr><tr><td>#L</td><td>#H </td><td>#A</td><td> LM (ppl) </td><td>MNLI-m</td><td> MRPC</td><td> SST-2</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3</td><td>768</td><td>12</td><td>5.84</td><td>77.9</td><td>79.8</td><td>88.4</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>768</td><td>3</td><td>5.24</td><td>80.6</td><td>82.2</td><td>90.7</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>768</td><td>12</td><td>4.68</td><td>81.9</td><td>84.8</td><td>91.3</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>768</td><td>12</td><td>3.99</td><td>84.4</td><td>86.7</td><td>92.9</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td> 1024</td><td>16</td><td>3.54</td><td>85.7</td><td>86.9</td><td>93.3</td></tr><tr><td>24 </td><td>1024</td><td>16</td><td>3.23</td><td>86.6</td><td>87.8</td><td>93.7</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>\n\nTable 6:Ablation over BERT model size. #L = the number of layers; #H = hidden size; #A = number of attention heads. “LM (ppl)” is the masked LM perplexity of held-out training data.\n\n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>System</td><td>Dev F1</td><td>Test F1</td></tr><tr><td>ELMo (Peters et al., 2018a)</td><td>95.7</td><td>92.2</td></tr><tr><td>CVT (Clark et al., 2018)</td><td>-</td><td>92.6</td></tr><tr><td>CSE (Akbik et al., 2018)</td><td>-</td><td>93.1</td></tr><tr><td>Fine-tuning approach</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>BERTLARGE</td><td>96.6</td><td>92.8</td></tr><tr><td>BERTBASE</td><td>96.4</td><td>92.4</td></tr><tr><td>Feature-based approach (BERTBASE)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Embeddings</td><td>91.0</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Second-to-Last Hidden</td><td>95.6</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Last Hidden</td><td>94.9</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Weighted Sum Last Four Hidden</td><td>95.9</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Concat Last Four Hidden</td><td>96.1</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Weighted Sum All 12 Layers</td><td>95.5</td><td>-</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nTable 7: CoNLL-2003 Named Entity Recognition results.

We use the representation of the frst sub-token as the input to the token-leveli classifer over the NER label set.i\n\nTo ablate the fne-tuning approach, we apply thei feature-based approach by extracting the activations from one or more layers without fne-tuningi any parameters of BERT. These contextual embeddings are used as input to a randomly initialized two-layer 768-dimensional BiLSTM before the classifcation layer.i\n\nResults are presented in Table 7. BERTLARGE performs competitively with state-of-the-art methods. The best performing method concatenates the token representations from the top four hidden layers of the pre-trained Transformer, which is only 0.3 F1 behind fne-tuning the entire model. Thisi demonstrates that BERT is effective for both fne-i tuning and feature-based approaches.\n\n## 6Conclusion\n\nRecent empirical improvements due to transfer learning with language models have demonstrated that rich, unsupervised pre-training is an integral part of many language understanding systems. In particular, these results enable even low-resource tasks to beneft from deep unidirectional architec-i tures. Our major contribution is further generalizing these fndings to deep bidirectional architec-i tures, allowing the same pre-trained model to successfully tackle a broad set of NLP tasks.\n\n\n\n## References\n\nAlan Akbik, Duncan Blythe, and Roland Vollgraf.2018.

The purpose of this is to bias the representation towards the actual observed word.\n\nThe advantage of this procedure is that the Transformer encoder does not know which words it will be asked to predict or which have been replaced by random words, so it is forced to keep a distributional contextual representation of every input token.Additionally, because random replacement only occurs for $1.5\\%$ of all tokens(i.e., $10\\%$ of $15\\%$ , this does not seem to harm the model’s language understanding capability. In Section C.2, we evaluate the impact this procedure.\n\nCompared to standard langauge model training,the masked LM only make predictions on $15\\%$ of tokens in each batch, which suggests that more pre-training steps may be required for the model\n\n\n\n![ef638b1c92292a23c937396e1dbfefe7](imgs/ef638b1c92292a23c937396e1dbfefe7.jpg)\n\nFigure 3: Differences in pre-training model architectures. BERT uses a bidirectional Transformer. OpenAI GPT uses a left-to-right Transformer. ELMo uses the concatenation of independently trained left-to-right and right-toleft LSTMs to generate features for downstream tasks. Among the three, only BERT representations are jointly conditioned on both left and right context in all layers. In addition to the architecture differences, BERT and OpenAI GPT are fne-tuning approaches, while ELMo is a feature-based approach.i\n\nto converge. In Section C.1 we demonstrate that MLM does converge marginally slower than a leftto-right model (which predicts every token), but the empirical improvements of the MLM model far outweigh the increased training cost.\n\nNext Sentence PredictionThe next sentence prediction task can be illustrated in the following examples.\n\nInput = [CLS] the man went to [MASK] store [SEP]\n\nhe bought a gallon [MASK] milk [SEP]\n\nLabel = IsNext\n\nInput = [CLS] the man [MASK] to the store [SEP]\n\npenguin [MASK] are flight ##less birds [SEP]Label = NotNext\n\n## A.2Pre-training Procedure\n\nTo generate each training input sequence, we sample two spans of text from the corpus, which we refer to as “sentences” even though they are typically much longer than single sentences (but can be shorter also). The frst sentence receives the Ai embedding and the second receives the B embedding. $50\\%$ of the time B is the actual next sentence that follows $A$  and $50\\%$ of the time it is a random sentence, which is done for the “next sentence prediction” task. They are sampled such that the combined length is $\\leq512$ tokens. The LM masking is applied after WordPiece tokenization with a uniform masking rate of $15\\%,$  and no special consideration given to partial word pieces.\n\nWe train with batch size of 256 sequences (256 sequences * 512 tokens $=128{,}000$ tokens/batch)for 1,000,000 steps, which is approximately 40epochs over the 3.3 billion word corpus.We use Adam with learning rate of 1e-4, $\\beta_{1}=0.9,$  $\\beta_{2}=0.999,$ 2 weight decay of 0.01, learning rate warmup over the frst 10,000 steps, and lineari decay of the learning rate. We use a dropout probability of 0.1 on all layers. We use a gelu activation (Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2016) rather than the standard relu, following OpenAI GPT. The training loss is the sum of the mean masked LM likelihood and the mean next sentence prediction likelihood.\n\nTraining of BERTBASE was performed on 4 Cloud TPUs in Pod confguration (16 TPU chipsi total).13 Training of BERTLARGE was performed on 16 Cloud TPUs (64 TPU chips total). Each pretraining took 4 days to complete.\n\nLonger sequences are disproportionately expensive because attention is quadratic to the sequence length. To speed up pretraing in our experiments,we pre-train the model with sequence length of 128 for $90\\%$  of the steps. Then, we train the rest $10\\%$ of the steps of sequence of 512 to learn the positional embeddings.\n\n## A.3Fine-tuning Procedure\n\nFor fne-tuning, most model hyperparameters arei the same as in pre-training, with the exception of the batch size, learning rate, and number of training epochs. The dropout probability was always kept at 0.1. The optimal hyperparameter values are task-specifc, but we found the following rangei of possible values to work well across all tasks:\n\n## Batch size: 16, 32\n\n\n\nLearning rate (Adam): 5e-5, 3e-5, 2e-5\n\n## Number of epochs: 2, 3, 4\n\nWe also observed that large data sets (e.g.,100k+ labeled training examples) were far less sensitive to hyperparameter choice than small data sets. Fine-tuning is typically very fast, so it is reasonable to simply run an exhaustive search over the above parameters and choose the model that performs best on the development set.\n\n## A.4Comparison of BERT, ELMo ,and OpenAI GPT\n\nHere we studies the differences in recent popular representation learning models including ELMo,OpenAI GPT and BERT. The comparisons between the model architectures are shown visually in Figure 3. Note that in addition to the architecture differences, BERT and OpenAI GPT are fne-i tuning approaches, while ELMo is a feature-based approach.\n\nThe most comparable existing pre-training method to BERT is OpenAI GPT, which trains a left-to-right Transformer LM on a large text corpus. In fact, many of the design decisions in BERT were intentionally made to make it as close to GPT as possible so that the two methods could be minimally compared. The core argument of this work is that the bi-directionality and the two pretraining tasks presented in Section 3.1 account for the majority of the empirical improvements, but we do note that there are several other differences between how BERT and GPT were trained:\n\nGPT is trained on the BooksCorpus (800M words); BERT is trained on the BooksCorpus (800M words) and Wikipedia (2,500M words).\n\nGPT uses a sentence separator ([SEP]) and classifer token ([CLS]) which are only in-i troduced at fne-tuning time; BERT learnsi[SEP], [CLS] and sentence $A/B$  embeddings during pre-training.\n\nGPT was trained for 1M steps with a batch size of 32,000 words; BERT was trained for 1M steps with a batch size of 128,000 words.\n\nGPT used the same learning rate of 5e-5 for all fne-tuning experiments; BERT chooses ai task-specifc fne-tuning learning rate whichii performs the best on the development set.\n\nTo isolate the effect of these differences, we perform ablation experiments in Section 5.1 which demonstrate that the majority of the improvements are in fact coming from the two pre-training tasks and the bidirectionality they enable.\n\n## A.5Illustrations of Fine-tuning on Different Tasks\n\nThe illustration of fne-tuning BERT on differenti tasks can be seen in Figure 4. Our task-specifci models are formed by incorporating BERT with one additional output layer, so a minimal number of parameters need to be learned from scratch.Among the tasks, (a) and (b) are sequence-level tasks while (c) and (d) are token-level tasks. In the fgure,i $E$ represents the input embedding, $T_{i}$ represents the contextual representation of token i,[CLS] is the special symbol for classifcation out-i put, and [SEP] is the special symbol to separate non-consecutive token sequences.\n\n## BDetailed Experimental Setup\n\n## B.1Detailed Descriptions for the GLUE Benchmark Experiments.\n\nOurGLUEresultsinTable1areobtained fromhttps://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboardandhttps://blog.openai.com/language-unsupervised.The GLUE benchmark includes the following datasets, the descriptions of which were originally summarized in Wang et al. (2018a):\n\nMNLIMulti-Genre Natural Language Inference is a large-scale, crowdsourced entailment classif-i cation task (Williams et al., 2018). Given a pair of sentences, the goal is to predict whether the second sentence is an entailment, contradiction, or neutral with respect to the frst one.i\n\nQQPQuora Question Pairs is a binary classif-i cation task where the goal is to determine if two questions asked on Quora are semantically equivalent (Chen et al., 2018).\n\nQNLIQuestion Natural Language Inference is a version of the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) which has been converted to a binary classifcation task (Wangi et al., 2018a). The positive examples are (question, sentence) pairs which do contain the correct answer, and the negative examples are (question,sentence) from the same paragraph which do not contain the answer.\n\n\n\n![f25f582f7fa926558633c5328e637aa4](imgs/f25f582f7fa926558633c5328e637aa4.jpg)\n\nFigure 4: Illustrations of Fine-tuning BERT on Different Tasks.\n\nSST-2The Stanford Sentiment Treebank is a binary single-sentence classifcation task consist-i ing of sentences extracted from movie reviews with human annotations of their sentiment (Socher et al., 2013).\n\nCoLAThe Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability is a binary single-sentence classifcation task, wherei the goal is to predict whether an English sentence is linguistically “acceptable” or not (Warstadt et al., 2018).\n\nSTS-BThe Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark is a collection of sentence pairs drawn from news headlines and other sources (Cer et al.,2017). They were annotated with a score from 1 to 5 denoting how similar the two sentences are in terms of semantic meaning.\n\nMRPCMicrosoft Research Paraphrase Corpus consists of sentence pairs automatically extracted from online news sources, with human annotationsfor whether the sentences in the pair are semantically equivalent (Dolan and Brockett, 2005).\n\nRTERecognizing Textual Entailment is a binary entailment task similar to MNLI, but with much less training data (Bentivogli et al., 2009).14\n\nWNLIWinograd NLI is a small natural language inference dataset (Levesque et al., 2011).The GLUE webpage notes that there are issues with the construction of this dataset, 15 and every trained system that’s been submitted to GLUE has performed worse than the 65.1 baseline accuracy of predicting the majority class. We therefore exclude this set to be fair to OpenAI GPT. For our GLUE submission, we always predicted the majority class.\n\n## CAdditional Ablation Studies\n\n## C.1Effect of Number of Training Steps\n\nFigure 5 presents MNLI Dev accuracy after fne-i tuning from a checkpoint that has been pre-trained for $k$  steps. This allows us to answer the following questions:\n\n1.Question:Does BERT really need such a large amount of pre-training (128,000 words/batch * 1,000,000 steps) to achieve high fne-tuning accuracy?i Answer: Yes, BERTBASE achieves almost $1.0\\%$ additional accuracy on MNLI when trained on 1M steps compared to 500k steps.\n\n2.Question: Does MLM pre-training converge slower than LTR pre-training, since only $15\\%$ of words are predicted in each batch rather than every word?Answer: The MLM model does converge slightly slower than the LTR model. However, in terms of absolute accuracy the MLM model begins to outperform the LTR model almost immediately.\n\n## C.2Ablation for Different Masking Procedures\n\nIn Section 3.1, we mention that BERT uses a mixed strategy for masking the target tokens when pre-training with the masked language model(MLM) objective. The following is an ablation study to evaluate the effect of different masking strategies.\n\n![76949e1ea8f2d7b4724874e608494a82](imgs/76949e1ea8f2d7b4724874e608494a82.jpg)\n\nFigure 5: Ablation over number of training steps. This shows the MNLI accuracy after fne-tuning, startingi from model parameters that have been pre-trained for k steps. The $x$ -axis is the value of k.\n\nNote that the purpose of the masking strategies is to reduce the mismatch between pre-training and fne-tuning, as the [MASK] symbol never ap-i pears during the fne-tuning stage. We report thei Dev results for both MNLI and NER. For NER,we report both fne-tuning and feature-based ap-i proaches, as we expect the mismatch will be amplifed for the feature-based approach as the modeli will not have the chance to adjust the representations.\n\n\n\n<html><body><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Masking Rates</td><td colspan=\"3\">Dev Set Results</td></tr><tr><td>MASK SAME</td><td></td><td>RND</td><td>MNLI Fine-tune </td><td></td><td>NER Fine-tune Feature-based</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> $80\\%$ </td><td> $10\\%$ </td><td> $10\\%$ </td><td>84.2</td><td>95.4</td><td>94.9</td></tr><tr><td> $100\\%$ </td><td> $0\\%$ </td><td> $0\\%$ </td><td>84.3</td><td>94.9</td><td>94.0</td></tr><tr><td> $80\\%$ </td><td> $0\\%$ </td><td> $20\\%$ </td><td>84.1</td><td>95.2</td><td>94.6</td></tr><tr><td> $80\\%$ </td><td> $20\\%$ </td><td> $0\\%$ </td><td>84.4</td><td>95.2</td><td>94.7</td></tr><tr><td> $0\\%$ </td><td> $20\\%$ </td><td> $80\\%$ </td><td>83.7</td><td>94.8</td><td>94.6</td></tr><tr><td> $0\\%$ </td><td> $0\\%$ </td><td> $100\\%$ </td><td>83.6</td><td>94.9</td><td>94.6</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>\n\nTable 8: Ablation over different masking strategies.\n\nThe results are presented in Table 8. In the table,MASK means that we replace the target token with the [MASK] symbol for MLM; SAME means that we keep the target token as is; RND means that we replace the target token with another random token.\n\nThe numbers in the left part of the table represent the probabilities of the specifc strategies usedi during MLM pre-training (BERT uses $80\\%,10\\%,$  $10\\%$ . The right part of the paper represents the Dev set results. For the feature-based approach,we concatenate the last 4 layers of BERT as the features, which was shown to be the best approach in Section 5.3.\n\nFrom the table it can be seen that fne-tuning isi surprisingly robust to different masking strategies.However, as expected, using only the MASK strategy was problematic when applying the featurebased approach to NER. Interestingly, using only the RND strategy performs much worse than our strategy as well.\n\n","msg":"","ocr_all":false,"page_count":16,"pages":[{"abandon_blocks":[{"bbox":{"x0":19,"x1":79,"y0":499,"y1":1237},"conf":0.4424,"font_size":0.0,"label":"Abandon","label_id":2,"lines":[{"bbox":{"x0":28,"x1":76,"y0":505,"y1":1226},"font_size":0.0,"text":"4cs.CL]  2[ May 2019.rXiv:1810a04805v2  "}],"source":"layout det","text":""}],"blocks":[{"bbox":{"x0":220,"x1":975,"y0":131,"y1":210},"conf":0.9413,"font_size":0.0,"label":"Title","label_id":0,"lines":[{"bbox":{"x0":230,"x1":962,"y0":139,"y1":168},"font_size":0.0,"text":"BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for"},{"bbox":{"x0":434,"x1":757,"y0":168,"y1":205},"font_size":0.0,"text":"Language Understanding"}],"source":"layout det","text":"BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding"},{"bbox":{"x0":233,"x1":965,"y0":252,"y1":287},"conf":0.8003,"font_size":0.0,"label":"Text","label_id":1,"lines":[{"bbox":{"x0":241,"x1":957,"y0":260,"y1":284},"font_size":0.0,"text":"Jacob DevlinMing-Wei ChangKenton LeeKristina Toutanova"}],"source":"layout det","text":"Jacob DevlinMing-Wei ChangKenton LeeKristina Toutanova"},{"bbox":{"x0":491,"x1":708,"y0":288,"y1":315},"conf":0.8047,"font_size":0.0,"label":"Text","label_id":1,"lines":[{"bbox":{"x0":494,"x1":704,"y0":286,"y1":314},"font_size":0.0,"text":"Google AI Language"}],"source":"layout det","text":"Google AI Language"},{"bbox":{"x0":209,"x1":995,"y0":316,"y1":350},"conf":0.8246,"font_size":0.0,"label":"Text","label_id":1,"lines":[{"bbox":{"x0":216,"x1":985,"y0":318,"y1":342},"font_size":0.0,"text":"{jacobdevlin,mingweichang,kentonl,kristout}@google.com"}],"source":"layout det","text":"{jacobdevlin,mingweichang,kentonl,kristout}@google.com"},{"bbox":{"x0":308,"x1":416,"y0":442,"y1":476},"conf":0.8509,"font_size":0.0,"label":"Title","label_id":0,"lines":[{"bbox":{"x0":317,"x1":408,"y0":449,"y1":468},"font_size":0.0,"text":"Abstract"}],"source":"layout det","text":"Abstract"},{"bbox":{"x0":165,"x1":558,"y0":485,"y1":850},"conf":0.9821,"font_size":0.0,"label":"Text","label_id":1,"lines":[{"bbox":{"x0":175,"x1":546,"y0":488,"y1":510},"font_size":0.0,"text":"We introduce a new language representa-"},{"bbox":{"x0":174,"x1":549,"y0":510,"y1":537},"font_size":0.0,"text":"tion model called BERT, which stands for"},{"bbox":{"x0":175,"x1":549,"y0":537,"y1":560},"font_size":0.0,"text":"Bidirectional Encoder Representations from"},{"bbox":{"x0":174,"x1":546,"y0":558,"y1":584},"font_size":0.0,"text":"Transformers.

Among the three, only BERT representations are jointly conditioned on both left and right context in all layers. In addition to the architecture differences, BERT and OpenAI GPT are fne-tuning approaches, while ELMo is a feature-based approach.i"},{"bbox":{"x0":135,"x1":588,"y0":524,"y1":666},"conf":0.9703,"font_size":0.0,"label":"Text","label_id":1,"lines":[{"bbox":{"x0":140,"x1":587,"y0":526,"y1":549},"font_size":0.0,"text":"to converge.

Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding\nJacob DevlinMing-Wei ChangKenton LeeKristina Toutanova\nGoogle AI Language\n{jacobdevlin,mingweichang,kentonl,kristout}@google.com\nAbstract\nWe introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pretrain deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fne-i tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial taskspecifc architecture modifcations.ii\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful.It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement),MultiNLI accuracy to $86.7\\%$ (4 $.6\\%$ absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1(5.1 point absolute improvement).\n1Introduction\nLanguage model pre-training has been shown to be effective for improving many natural language processing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder,2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as natural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;Williams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan and Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the relationships between sentences by analyzing them holistically, as well as token-level tasks such as named entity recognition and question answering,where models are required to produce fne-grainedi output at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).\nThere are two existing strategies for applying pre-trained language representations to downstream tasks: feature-based and fne-tuning. Thei feature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters et al., 2018a), uses task-specifc architectures thati include the pre-trained representations as additional features. The fne-tuning approach, such asi the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI GPT) (Radford et al., 2018), introduces minimal task-specifc parameters, and is trained on thei downstream tasks by simply fne-tuningi $all$ pretrained parameters. The two approaches share the same objective function during pre-training, where they use unidirectional language models to learn general language representations.\nWe argue that current techniques restrict the power of the pre-trained representations, especially for the fne-tuning approaches.The ma-i jor limitation is that standard language models are unidirectional, and this limits the choice of architectures that can be used during pre-training. For example, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-toright architecture, where every token can only attend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers of the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Such restrictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks,and could be very harmful when applying fne-i tuning based approaches to token-level tasks such as question answering, where it is crucial to incorporate context from both directions.\nIn this paper, we improve the fne-tuning basedi approaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional EncoderRepresentationsfromTransformers.BERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidirectionality constraint by using a “masked language model” (MLM) pre-training objective, inspired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953).The masked language model randomly masks some of the tokens from the input, and the objective is to predict the original vocabulary id of the maskedword based only on its context.Unlike left-toright language model pre-training, the MLM objective enables the representation to fuse the left and the right context, which allows us to pretrain a deep bidirectional Transformer. In addition to the masked language model, we also use a “next sentence prediction” task that jointly pretrains text-pair representations. The contributions of our paper are as follows:\nWe demonstrate the importance of bidirectional pre-training for language representations. Unlike Radford et al. (2018), which uses unidirectional language models for pre-training, BERT uses masked language models to enable pretrained deep bidirectional representations. This is also in contrast to Peters et al. (2018a), which uses a shallow concatenation of independently trained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs.\nWe show that pre-trained representations reduce the need for many heavily-engineered taskspecifc architectures. BERT is the frst fne-iii tuning based representation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on a large suite of sentence-level and token-level tasks, outperforming many task-specifc architectures.i\nBERT advances the state of the art for eleven NLP tasks.The code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/google-research/bert.\n2Related Work\nThere is a long history of pre-training general language representations, and we briefy review thel most widely-used approaches in this section.\n2.1Unsupervised Feature-based Approaches\nLearning widely applicable representations of words has been an active area of research for decades, including non-neural (Brown et al., 1992;Ando and Zhang, 2005; Blitzer et al., 2006) and neural (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al.,2014) methods.Pre-trained word embeddings are an integral part of modern NLP systems, offering signifcant improvements over embeddingsi learned from scratch (Turian et al., 2010). To pretrain word embedding vectors, left-to-right language modeling objectives have been used (Mnih and Hinton, 2009), as well as objectives to discriminate correct from incorrect words in left and right context (Mikolov et al., 2013).\nThese approaches have been generalized to coarser granularities, such as sentence embeddings (Kiros et al., 2015; Logeswaran and Lee,2018) or paragraph embeddings (Le and Mikolov,2014).To train sentence representations, prior work has used objectives to rank candidate next sentences (Jernite et al., 2017; Logeswaran and Lee, 2018), left-to-right generation of next sentence words given a representation of the previous sentence (Kiros et al., 2015), or denoising autoencoder derived objectives (Hill et al., 2016).\nELMo and its predecessor (Peters et al., 2017,2018a) generalize traditional word embedding research along a different dimension. They extract context-sensitive features from a left-to-right and a right-to-left language model. The contextual representation of each token is the concatenation of the left-to-right and right-to-left representations.When integrating contextual word embeddings with existing task-specifc architectures, ELMoi advances the state of the art for several major NLP benchmarks (Peters et al., 2018a) including question answering (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), sentiment analysis (Socher et al., 2013), and named entity recognition (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder,2003). Melamud et al. (2016) proposed learning contextual representations through a task to predict a single word from both left and right context using LSTMs. Similar to ELMo, their model is feature-based and not deeply bidirectional. Fedus et al. (2018) shows that the cloze task can be used to improve the robustness of text generation models.\n2.2Unsupervised Fine-tuning Approaches\nAs with the feature-based approaches, the frsti works in this direction only pre-trained word embedding parameters from unlabeled text(Collobert and Weston, 2008).\nMore recently, sentence or document encoders which produce contextual token representations have been pre-trained from unlabeled text and fne-tuned for a supervised downstream task (Daii and Le, 2015; Howard and Ruder, 2018; Radford et al., 2018). The advantage of these approaches is that few parameters need to be learned from scratch.At least partly due to this advantage,OpenAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018) achieved previously state-of-the-art results on many sentencelevel tasks from the GLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2018a).Left-to-right language model-\n\nFigure 1: Overall pre-training and fne-tuning procedures for BERT. Apart from output layers, the same architec-i tures are used in both pre-training and fne-tuning. The same pre-trained model parameters are used to initializei models for different down-stream tasks. During fne-tuning, all parameters are fne-tuned. [CLS] is a specialii symbol added in front of every input example, and [SEP] is a special separator token (e.g. separating questions/answers).\ning and auto-encoder objectives have been used for pre-training such models (Howard and Ruder,2018; Radford et al., 2018; Dai and Le, 2015).\n2.3Transfer Learning from Supervised Data\nThere has also been work showing effective transfer from supervised tasks with large datasets, such as natural language inference (Conneau et al.,2017) and machine translation (McCann et al.,2017). Computer vision research has also demonstrated the importance of transfer learning from large pre-trained models, where an effective recipe is to fne-tune models pre-trained with Ima-i geNet (Deng et al., 2009; Yosinski et al., 2014).\n3BERT\nWe introduce BERT and its detailed implementation in this section. There are two steps in our framework: pre-training and fne-tuning.Dur-i ing pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled data over different pre-training tasks.For fne-i tuning, the BERT model is frst initialized withi the pre-trained parameters, and all of the parameters are fne-tuned using labeled data from thei downstream tasks. Each downstream task has separate fne-tuned models, even though they are ini-i tialized with the same pre-trained parameters. The question-answering example in Figure 1 will serve as a running example for this section.\nA distinctive feature of BERT is its unifed ar-i chitecture across different tasks. There is mini-mal difference between the pre-trained architecture and the fnal downstream architecture.i\nModel ArchitectureBERT’s model architecture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer encoder based on the original implementation described in Vaswani et al. (2017) and released in the tensor2tensor library.1 Because the use of Transformers has become common and our implementation is almost identical to the original,we will omit an exhaustive background description of the model architecture and refer readers to Vaswani et al. (2017) as well as excellent guides such as “The Annotated Transformer.”2\nIn this work, we denote the number of layers(i.e., Transformer blocks) as $L.$  the hidden size as $H,$  and the number of self-attention heads as $A.^{3}$ We primarily report results on two model sizes:BERTBASE (L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Parameters=110M) and BERTLARGE (L=24, H=1024,A=16, Total Parameters=340M).\nBERTBASE was chosen to have the same model size as OpenAI GPT for comparison purposes.Critically, however, the BERT Transformer uses bidirectional self-attention, while the GPT Transformer uses constrained self-attention where every token can only attend to context to its left.4\n\nInput/Output RepresentationsTo make BERT handle a variety of down-stream tasks, our input representation is able to unambiguously represent both a single sentence and a pair of sentences(e.g., ⟨Question, Answer ⟩) in one token sequence.Throughout this work, a “sentence” can be an arbitrary span of contiguous text, rather than an actual linguistic sentence. A “sequence” refers to the input token sequence to BERT, which may be a single sentence or two sentences packed together.\nWe use WordPiece embeddings (Wu et al.,2016) with a 30,000 token vocabulary. The frsti token of every sequence is always a special classifcation token ([CLS]). The fnal hidden stateii corresponding to this token is used as the aggregate sequence representation for classifcationi tasks. Sentence pairs are packed together into a single sequence. We differentiate the sentences in two ways. First, we separate them with a special token ([SEP]). Second, we add a learned embedding to every token indicating whether it belongs to sentence A or sentence B. As shown in Figure 1,we denote input embedding as E, the fnal hiddeni vector of the special [CLS] token as $C \\in\\mathbb{R}^{H},$ and the fnal hidden vector for thei $i^{\\text{th}}$ input token as $T_{i} \\in\\mathbb{R}^{H}.$\nFor a given token, its input representation is constructed by summing the corresponding token,segment, and position embeddings. A visualization of this construction can be seen in Figure 2.\n3.1Pre-training BERT\nUnlike Peters et al. (2018a) and Radford et al.(2018), we do not use traditional left-to-right or right-to-left language models to pre-train BERT.Instead, we pre-train BERT using two unsupervised tasks, described in this section. This step is presented in the left part of Figure 1.\nTask #1: Masked LMIntuitively, it is reasonable to believe that a deep bidirectional model is strictly more powerful than either a left-to-right model or the shallow concatenation of a left-toright and a right-to-left model.Unfortunately,standard conditional language models can only be trained left-to-right $or$ right-to-left, since bidirectional conditioning would allow each word to indirectly “see itself”, and the model could trivially predict the target word in a multi-layered context.\nIn order to train a deep bidirectional representation, we simply mask some percentage of the input tokens at random, and then predict those masked tokens. We refer to this procedure as a “masked LM” (MLM), although it is often referred to as a Cloze task in the literature (Taylor, 1953). In this case, the fnal hidden vectors corresponding to thei mask tokens are fed into an output softmax over the vocabulary, as in a standard LM. In all of our experiments, we mask $15\\%$ of all WordPiece tokens in each sequence at random. In contrast to denoising auto-encoders (Vincent et al., 2008), we only predict the masked words rather than reconstructing the entire input.\nAlthough this allows us to obtain a bidirectional pre-trained model, a downside is that we are creating a mismatch between pre-training and fne-tuning, since the [MASK] token does not ap-i pear during fne-tuning. To mitigate this, we doi not always replace “masked” words with the actual [MASK] token. The training data generator chooses $15\\%$  of the token positions at random for prediction. If the $i$ th token is chosen, we replace the $i$ th token with (1) the [MASK] token $80\\%$ of the time (2) a random token $10\\%$  of the time (3)the unchanged $i$ -th token $10\\%$ of the time. Then, $T_{i}$  will be used to predict the original token with cross entropy loss. We compare variations of this procedure in Appendix C.2.\nTask #2:Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)Many important downstream tasks such as Question Answering (QA) and Natural Language Inference (NLI) are based on understanding the relationship between two sentences, which is not directly captured by language modeling. In order to train a model that understands sentence relationships, we pre-train for a binarized next sentence prediction task that can be trivially generated from any monolingual corpus. Specifcally,i when choosing the sentences $A$  and B for each pretraining example, $50\\%$ of the time B is the actual next sentence that follows A (labeled as IsNext),and $50\\%$  of the time it is a random sentence from the corpus (labeled as NotNext).As we show in Figure 1, $C$ is used for next sentence prediction (NSP).5 Despite its simplicity, we demonstrate in Section 5.1 that pre-training towards this task is very benefcial to both QA and NLI. 6i\n\nFigure 2: BERT input representation. The input embeddings are the sum of the token embeddings, the segmentation embeddings and the position embeddings.\nThe NSP task is closely related to representationlearning objectives used in Jernite et al. (2017) and Logeswaran and Lee (2018). However, in prior work, only sentence embeddings are transferred to down-stream tasks, where BERT transfers all parameters to initialize end-task model parameters.\nPre-training data The pre-training procedure largely follows the existing literature on language model pre-training. For the pre-training corpus we use the BooksCorpus (800M words) (Zhu et al.,2015) and English Wikipedia (2,500M words).For Wikipedia we extract only the text passages and ignore lists, tables, and headers. It is critical to use a document-level corpus rather than a shuffed sentence-level corpus such as the Billionl Word Benchmark (Chelba et al., 2013) in order to extract long contiguous sequences.\n3.2Fine-tuning BERT\nFine-tuning is straightforward since the selfattention mechanism in the Transformer allows BERT to model many downstream tasks—whether they involve single text or text pairs—by swapping out the appropriate inputs and outputs.For applications involving text pairs, a common pattern is to independently encode text pairs before applying bidirectional cross attention, such as Parikh et al. (2016); Seo et al. (2017). BERT instead uses the self-attention mechanism to unify these two stages, as encoding a concatenated text pair with self-attention effectively includes bidirectional cross attention between two sentences.\nFor each task, we simply plug in the taskspecifc inputs and outputs into BERT and fne-ii tune all the parameters end-to-end.At the input, sentence A and sentence B from pre-training are analogous to (1) sentence pairs in paraphrasing, (2) hypothesis-premise pairs in entailment, (3)question-passage pairs in question answering, and(4) a degenerate text- $\\varnothing$ pair in text classifcationi or sequence tagging. At the output, the token representations are fed into an output layer for tokenlevel tasks, such as sequence tagging or question answering, and the [CLS] representation is fed into an output layer for classifcation, such as en-i tailment or sentiment analysis.\nCompared to pre-training, fne-tuning is rela-i tively inexpensive. All of the results in the paper can be replicated in at most 1 hour on a single Cloud TPU, or a few hours on a GPU, starting from the exact same pre-trained model.7 We describe the task-specifc details in the correspond-i ing subsections of Section 4. More details can be found in Appendix A.5.\n4Experiments\nIn this section, we present BERT fne-tuning re-i sults on 11 NLP tasks.\n4.1GLUE\nThe General Language Understanding Evaluation(GLUE) benchmark (Wang et al., 2018a) is a collection of diverse natural language understanding tasks. Detailed descriptions of GLUE datasets are included in Appendix B.1.\nTo fne-tune on GLUE, we represent the inputi sequence (for single sentence or sentence pairs)as described in Section 3, and use the fnal hid-i den vector $C\\ \\in\\ \\mathbb{R}^{H}$ corresponding to the frsti input token ([CLS]) as the aggregate representation. The only new parameters introduced during fne-tuning are classifcation layer weightsii $W \\in$  $\\mathbb{R}^{K\\times H},$  where $K$  is the number of labels. We com- pute a standard classifcation loss withi $C$ and W, i.e., $\\log(\\text{softmax}(CW^{T})).$\n\n\n\n<html><body><table><thead><tr><td>System</td><td>MNLI-(m/mm) 392k</td><td>QQP 363k</td><td>QNLI 108k</td><td>SST-2 67k</td><td>CoLA 8.5k</td><td>STS-B 5.7k</td><td>MRPC 3.5k</td><td>RTE 2.5k</td><td>Average -</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Pre-OpenAI SOTA</td><td>80.6/80.1</td><td>66.1</td><td>82.3</td><td>93.2</td><td>35.0</td><td>81.0</td><td>86.0</td><td>61.7</td><td>74.0</td></tr><tr><td>BiLSTM+ELMo+Attn</td><td>76.4/76.1</td><td>64.8</td><td>79.8</td><td>90.4</td><td>36.0</td><td>73.3</td><td>84.9</td><td>56.8</td><td>71.0</td></tr><tr><td>OpenAI GPT</td><td>82.1/81.4</td><td>70.3</td><td>87.4</td><td>91.3</td><td>45.4</td><td>80.0</td><td>82.3</td><td>56.0</td><td>75.1</td></tr><tr><td>BERTBASE</td><td>84.6/83.4</td><td>71.2</td><td>90.5</td><td>93.5</td><td>52.1</td><td>85.8</td><td>88.9</td><td>66.4</td><td>79.6</td></tr><tr><td>BERTLARGE</td><td>86.7/85.9</td><td>72.1</td><td>92.7</td><td>94.9</td><td>60.5</td><td>86.5</td><td>89.3</td><td>70.1</td><td>82.1</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>\n\nTable 1: GLUE Test results, scored by the evaluation server (https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard).The number below each task denotes the number of training examples. The “Average” column is slightly different than the offcial GLUE score, since we exclude the problematic WNLI set.8 BERT and OpenAI GPT are single-i model, single task. F1 scores are reported for QQP and MRPC, Spearman correlations are reported for STS-B, and accuracy scores are reported for the other tasks. We exclude entries that use BERT as one of their components.\nWe use a batch size of 32 and fne-tune for 3i epochs over the data for all GLUE tasks. For each task, we selected the best fne-tuning learning ratei(among 5e-5, 4e-5, 3e-5, and 2e-5) on the Dev set.Additionally, for BERTLARGE we found that fne-i tuning was sometimes unstable on small datasets,so we ran several random restarts and selected the best model on the Dev set. With random restarts,we use the same pre-trained checkpoint but perform different fne-tuning data shuffing and clas-il sifer layer initialization.9i\nResults are presented in Table 1.Both BERTBASE and BERTLARGE outperform all systems on all tasks by a substantial margin, obtaining $4.5\\%$ and $7.0\\%$ respective average accuracy im- provement over the prior state of the art. Note that BERTBASE and OpenAI GPT are nearly identical in terms of model architecture apart from the attention masking. For the largest and most widely reported GLUE task, MNLI, BERT obtains a $4.6\\%$ absolute accuracy improvement. On the offciali GLUE leaderboard10, BERTLARGE obtains a score of 80.5, compared to OpenAI GPT, which obtains 72.8 as of the date of writing.\nWe fnd that BERTLARGE signifcantly outper-ii forms BERTBASE across all tasks, especially those with very little training data. The effect of model size is explored more thoroughly in Section 5.2.\n4.2SQuAD v1.1\nTheStanfordQuestionAnsweringDataset(SQuAD v1.1) is a collection of 100k crowdsourced question/answer pairs (Rajpurkar et al.,2016).Given a question and a passage fromWikipedia containing the answer, the task is to predict the answer text span in the passage.\nAs shown in Figure 1, in the question answering task, we represent the input question and passage as a single packed sequence, with the question using the A embedding and the passage using the B embedding. We only introduce a start vector $S \\in\\mathbb{R}^{H}$ and an end vector $E \\in\\mathbb{R}^{H}$ during fne-tuning. The probability of wordi $i$  being the start of the answer span is computed as a dot product between $T_{i}$ and $S$  followed by a softmax over all of the words in the paragraph: $P_{i}=\\tfrac{e^{S\\cdot T_{i}}}{\\sum_{j}e^{S\\cdot T_{j}}}.$ The analogous formula is used for the end of the answer span. The score of a candidate span from position $i$  to position j is defned asi $S\\cdot T_{i}+E\\cdot T_{j},$ and the maximum scoring span where $j \\geq i$  is used as a prediction. The training objective is the sum of the log-likelihoods of the correct start and end positions. We fne-tune for 3 epochs with ai learning rate of 5e-5 and a batch size of 32.\nTable 2 shows top leaderboard entries as well as results from top published systems (Seo et al.,2017; Clark and Gardner, 2018; Peters et al.,2018a; Hu et al., 2018). The top results from the SQuAD leaderboard do not have up-to-date public system descriptions available,11 and are allowed to use any public data when training their systems.We therefore use modest data augmentation in our system by frst fne-tuning on TriviaQA (Joshiii et al., 2017) befor fne-tuning on SQuAD.i\nOur best performing system outperforms the top leaderboard system by $+1.5$  F1 in ensembling and+1.3 F1 as a single system. In fact, our single BERT model outperforms the top ensemble system in terms of F1 score.

Given a sentence, the task is to choose the most plausible continuation among four choices.\nWhen fne-tuning on the SWAG dataset, wei construct four input sequences, each containing the concatenation of the given sentence (sentence A) and a possible continuation (sentence B). The only task-specifc parameters introduced is a vec-i tor whose dot product with the [CLS] token representation $C$ denotes a score for each choice which is normalized with a softmax layer.\nWe fne-tune the model for 3 epochs with ai learning rate of 2e-5 and a batch size of 16.

The left-only constraint was also applied at fne-tuning, because removingi it introduced a pre-train/fne-tune mismatch thati degraded downstream performance. Additionally,this model was pre-trained without the NSP task.This is directly comparable to OpenAI GPT, but using our larger training dataset, our input representation, and our fne-tuning scheme.i\nWe frst examine the impact brought by the NSPi task.In Table 5, we show that removing NSP hurts performance signifcantly on QNLI, MNLI,i and SQuAD 1.1. Next, we evaluate the impact of training bidirectional representations by comparing “No NSP” to “LTR & No NSP”. The LTR model performs worse than the MLM model on all tasks, with large drops on MRPC and SQuAD.\nFor SQuAD it is intuitively clear that a LTR model will perform poorly at token predictions,since the token-level hidden states have no rightside context. In order to make a good faith attempt at strengthening the LTR system, we added a randomly initialized BiLSTM on top. This does signifcantly improve results on SQuAD, but theiresults are still far worse than those of the pretrained bidirectional models. The BiLSTM hurts performance on the GLUE tasks.\nWe recognize that it would also be possible to train separate LTR and RTL models and represent each token as the concatenation of the two models, as ELMo does. However: (a) this is twice as expensive as a single bidirectional model; (b) this is non-intuitive for tasks like QA, since the RTL model would not be able to condition the answer on the question; (c) this it is strictly less powerful than a deep bidirectional model, since it can use both left and right context at every layer.\n5.2Effect of Model Size\nIn this section, we explore the effect of model size on fne-tuning task accuracy. We trained a numberi of BERT models with a differing number of layers,hidden units, and attention heads, while otherwise using the same hyperparameters and training procedure as described previously.\nResults on selected GLUE tasks are shown in Table 6. In this table, we report the average Dev Set accuracy from 5 random restarts of fne-tuning.i We can see that larger models lead to a strict accuracy improvement across all four datasets, even for MRPC which only has 3,600 labeled training examples, and is substantially different from the pre-training tasks. It is also perhaps surprising that we are able to achieve such signifcanti improvements on top of models which are already quite large relative to the existing literature.For example, the largest Transformer explored in Vaswani et al. (2017) is (L=6, H=1024, A=16)with 100M parameters for the encoder, and the largest Transformer we have found in the literature is (L=64, H=512, A=2) with 235M parameters(Al-Rfou et al., 2018). By contrast, BERTBASE contains 110M parameters and BERTLARGE contains 340M parameters.\nIt has long been known that increasing the model size will lead to continual improvements on large-scale tasks such as machine translation and language modeling, which is demonstrated by the LM perplexity of held-out training data shown in Table 6.However, we believe that this is the frst work to demonstrate convinc-i ingly that scaling to extreme model sizes also leads to large improvements on very small scale tasks, provided that the model has been suff-i ciently pre-trained. Peters et al. (2018b) presentedmixed results on the downstream task impact of increasing the pre-trained bi-LM size from two to four layers and Melamud et al. (2016) mentioned in passing that increasing hidden dimension size from 200 to 600 helped, but increasing further to 1,000 did not bring further improvements. Both of these prior works used a featurebased approach — we hypothesize that when the model is fne-tuned directly on the downstreami tasks and uses only a very small number of randomly initialized additional parameters, the taskspecifc models can beneft from the larger, moreii expressive pre-trained representations even when downstream task data is very small.\n5.3Feature-based Approach with BERT\nAll of the BERT results presented so far have used the fne-tuning approach, where a simple classif-ii cation layer is added to the pre-trained model, and all parameters are jointly fne-tuned on a down-i stream task. However, the feature-based approach,where fxed features are extracted from the pre-i trained model, has certain advantages. First, not all tasks can be easily represented by a Transformer encoder architecture, and therefore require a task-specifc model architecture to be added.i Second, there are major computational beneftsi to pre-compute an expensive representation of the training data once and then run many experiments with cheaper models on top of this representation.\nIn this section, we compare the two approaches by applying BERT to the CoNLL-2003 Named Entity Recognition (NER) task (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003). In the input to BERT, we use a case-preserving WordPiece model, and we include the maximal document context provided by the data. Following standard practice, we formulate this as a tagging task but do not use a CRF\n\n\n<html><body><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Hyperparams</td><td colspan=\"3\">Dev Set Accuracy</td></tr><tr><td>#L</td><td>#H </td><td>#A</td><td> LM (ppl) </td><td>MNLI-m</td><td> MRPC</td><td> SST-2</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3</td><td>768</td><td>12</td><td>5.84</td><td>77.9</td><td>79.8</td><td>88.4</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>768</td><td>3</td><td>5.24</td><td>80.6</td><td>82.2</td><td>90.7</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>768</td><td>12</td><td>4.68</td><td>81.9</td><td>84.8</td><td>91.3</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>768</td><td>12</td><td>3.99</td><td>84.4</td><td>86.7</td><td>92.9</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td> 1024</td><td>16</td><td>3.54</td><td>85.7</td><td>86.9</td><td>93.3</td></tr><tr><td>24 </td><td>1024</td><td>16</td><td>3.23</td><td>86.6</td><td>87.8</td><td>93.7</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>\n\nTable 6:Ablation over BERT model size. #L = the number of layers; #H = hidden size; #A = number of attention heads. “LM (ppl)” is the masked LM perplexity of held-out training data.\n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>System</td><td>Dev F1</td><td>Test F1</td></tr><tr><td>ELMo (Peters et al., 2018a)</td><td>95.7</td><td>92.2</td></tr><tr><td>CVT (Clark et al., 2018)</td><td>-</td><td>92.6</td></tr><tr><td>CSE (Akbik et al., 2018)</td><td>-</td><td>93.1</td></tr><tr><td>Fine-tuning approach</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>BERTLARGE</td><td>96.6</td><td>92.8</td></tr><tr><td>BERTBASE</td><td>96.4</td><td>92.4</td></tr><tr><td>Feature-based approach (BERTBASE)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Embeddings</td><td>91.0</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Second-to-Last Hidden</td><td>95.6</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Last Hidden</td><td>94.9</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Weighted Sum Last Four Hidden</td><td>95.9</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Concat Last Four Hidden</td><td>96.1</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Weighted Sum All 12 Layers</td><td>95.5</td><td>-</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nTable 7: CoNLL-2003 Named Entity Recognition results.

We use the representation of the frst sub-token as the input to the token-leveli classifer over the NER label set.i\nTo ablate the fne-tuning approach, we apply thei feature-based approach by extracting the activations from one or more layers without fne-tuningi any parameters of BERT. These contextual embeddings are used as input to a randomly initialized two-layer 768-dimensional BiLSTM before the classifcation layer.i\nResults are presented in Table 7. BERTLARGE performs competitively with state-of-the-art methods. The best performing method concatenates the token representations from the top four hidden layers of the pre-trained Transformer, which is only 0.3 F1 behind fne-tuning the entire model. Thisi demonstrates that BERT is effective for both fne-i tuning and feature-based approaches.\n6Conclusion\nRecent empirical improvements due to transfer learning with language models have demonstrated that rich, unsupervised pre-training is an integral part of many language understanding systems. In particular, these results enable even low-resource tasks to beneft from deep unidirectional architec-i tures. Our major contribution is further generalizing these fndings to deep bidirectional architec-i tures, allowing the same pre-trained model to successfully tackle a broad set of NLP tasks.\n\nReferences\nAlan Akbik, Duncan Blythe, and Roland Vollgraf.2018.

The purpose of this is to bias the representation towards the actual observed word.\nThe advantage of this procedure is that the Transformer encoder does not know which words it will be asked to predict or which have been replaced by random words, so it is forced to keep a distributional contextual representation of every input token.Additionally, because random replacement only occurs for $1.5\\%$ of all tokens(i.e., $10\\%$ of $15\\%$ , this does not seem to harm the model’s language understanding capability. In Section C.2, we evaluate the impact this procedure.\nCompared to standard langauge model training,the masked LM only make predictions on $15\\%$ of tokens in each batch, which suggests that more pre-training steps may be required for the model\n\nFigure 3: Differences in pre-training model architectures. BERT uses a bidirectional Transformer. OpenAI GPT uses a left-to-right Transformer. ELMo uses the concatenation of independently trained left-to-right and right-toleft LSTMs to generate features for downstream tasks. Among the three, only BERT representations are jointly conditioned on both left and right context in all layers. In addition to the architecture differences, BERT and OpenAI GPT are fne-tuning approaches, while ELMo is a feature-based approach.i\nto converge. In Section C.1 we demonstrate that MLM does converge marginally slower than a leftto-right model (which predicts every token), but the empirical improvements of the MLM model far outweigh the increased training cost.\nNext Sentence PredictionThe next sentence prediction task can be illustrated in the following examples.\nInput = [CLS] the man went to [MASK] store [SEP]\nhe bought a gallon [MASK] milk [SEP]\nLabel = IsNext\nInput = [CLS] the man [MASK] to the store [SEP]\npenguin [MASK] are flight ##less birds [SEP]Label = NotNext\nA.2Pre-training Procedure\nTo generate each training input sequence, we sample two spans of text from the corpus, which we refer to as “sentences” even though they are typically much longer than single sentences (but can be shorter also). The frst sentence receives the Ai embedding and the second receives the B embedding. $50\\%$ of the time B is the actual next sentence that follows $A$  and $50\\%$ of the time it is a random sentence, which is done for the “next sentence prediction” task. They are sampled such that the combined length is $\\leq512$ tokens. The LM masking is applied after WordPiece tokenization with a uniform masking rate of $15\\%,$  and no special consideration given to partial word pieces.\nWe train with batch size of 256 sequences (256 sequences * 512 tokens $=128{,}000$ tokens/batch)for 1,000,000 steps, which is approximately 40epochs over the 3.3 billion word corpus.We use Adam with learning rate of 1e-4, $\\beta_{1}=0.9,$  $\\beta_{2}=0.999,$ 2 weight decay of 0.01, learning rate warmup over the frst 10,000 steps, and lineari decay of the learning rate. We use a dropout probability of 0.1 on all layers. We use a gelu activation (Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2016) rather than the standard relu, following OpenAI GPT. The training loss is the sum of the mean masked LM likelihood and the mean next sentence prediction likelihood.\nTraining of BERTBASE was performed on 4 Cloud TPUs in Pod confguration (16 TPU chipsi total).13 Training of BERTLARGE was performed on 16 Cloud TPUs (64 TPU chips total). Each pretraining took 4 days to complete.\nLonger sequences are disproportionately expensive because attention is quadratic to the sequence length. To speed up pretraing in our experiments,we pre-train the model with sequence length of 128 for $90\\%$  of the steps. Then, we train the rest $10\\%$ of the steps of sequence of 512 to learn the positional embeddings.\nA.3Fine-tuning Procedure\nFor fne-tuning, most model hyperparameters arei the same as in pre-training, with the exception of the batch size, learning rate, and number of training epochs. The dropout probability was always kept at 0.1. The optimal hyperparameter values are task-specifc, but we found the following rangei of possible values to work well across all tasks:\nBatch size: 16, 32\n\nLearning rate (Adam): 5e-5, 3e-5, 2e-5\nNumber of epochs: 2, 3, 4\nWe also observed that large data sets (e.g.,100k+ labeled training examples) were far less sensitive to hyperparameter choice than small data sets. Fine-tuning is typically very fast, so it is reasonable to simply run an exhaustive search over the above parameters and choose the model that performs best on the development set.\nA.4Comparison of BERT, ELMo ,and OpenAI GPT\nHere we studies the differences in recent popular representation learning models including ELMo,OpenAI GPT and BERT. The comparisons between the model architectures are shown visually in Figure 3. Note that in addition to the architecture differences, BERT and OpenAI GPT are fne-i tuning approaches, while ELMo is a feature-based approach.\nThe most comparable existing pre-training method to BERT is OpenAI GPT, which trains a left-to-right Transformer LM on a large text corpus. In fact, many of the design decisions in BERT were intentionally made to make it as close to GPT as possible so that the two methods could be minimally compared. The core argument of this work is that the bi-directionality and the two pretraining tasks presented in Section 3.1 account for the majority of the empirical improvements, but we do note that there are several other differences between how BERT and GPT were trained:\nGPT is trained on the BooksCorpus (800M words); BERT is trained on the BooksCorpus (800M words) and Wikipedia (2,500M words).\nGPT uses a sentence separator ([SEP]) and classifer token ([CLS]) which are only in-i troduced at fne-tuning time; BERT learnsi[SEP], [CLS] and sentence $A/B$  embeddings during pre-training.\nGPT was trained for 1M steps with a batch size of 32,000 words; BERT was trained for 1M steps with a batch size of 128,000 words.\nGPT used the same learning rate of 5e-5 for all fne-tuning experiments; BERT chooses ai task-specifc fne-tuning learning rate whichii performs the best on the development set.\nTo isolate the effect of these differences, we perform ablation experiments in Section 5.1 which demonstrate that the majority of the improvements are in fact coming from the two pre-training tasks and the bidirectionality they enable.\nA.5Illustrations of Fine-tuning on Different Tasks\nThe illustration of fne-tuning BERT on differenti tasks can be seen in Figure 4. Our task-specifci models are formed by incorporating BERT with one additional output layer, so a minimal number of parameters need to be learned from scratch.Among the tasks, (a) and (b) are sequence-level tasks while (c) and (d) are token-level tasks. In the fgure,i $E$ represents the input embedding, $T_{i}$ represents the contextual representation of token i,[CLS] is the special symbol for classifcation out-i put, and [SEP] is the special symbol to separate non-consecutive token sequences.\nBDetailed Experimental Setup\nB.1Detailed Descriptions for the GLUE Benchmark Experiments.\nOurGLUEresultsinTable1areobtained fromhttps://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboardandhttps://blog.openai.com/language-unsupervised.The GLUE benchmark includes the following datasets, the descriptions of which were originally summarized in Wang et al. (2018a):\nMNLIMulti-Genre Natural Language Inference is a large-scale, crowdsourced entailment classif-i cation task (Williams et al., 2018). Given a pair of sentences, the goal is to predict whether the second sentence is an entailment, contradiction, or neutral with respect to the frst one.i\nQQPQuora Question Pairs is a binary classif-i cation task where the goal is to determine if two questions asked on Quora are semantically equivalent (Chen et al., 2018).\nQNLIQuestion Natural Language Inference is a version of the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) which has been converted to a binary classifcation task (Wangi et al., 2018a). The positive examples are (question, sentence) pairs which do contain the correct answer, and the negative examples are (question,sentence) from the same paragraph which do not contain the answer.\n\nFigure 4: Illustrations of Fine-tuning BERT on Different Tasks.\nSST-2The Stanford Sentiment Treebank is a binary single-sentence classifcation task consist-i ing of sentences extracted from movie reviews with human annotations of their sentiment (Socher et al., 2013).\nCoLAThe Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability is a binary single-sentence classifcation task, wherei the goal is to predict whether an English sentence is linguistically “acceptable” or not (Warstadt et al., 2018).\nSTS-BThe Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark is a collection of sentence pairs drawn from news headlines and other sources (Cer et al.,2017). They were annotated with a score from 1 to 5 denoting how similar the two sentences are in terms of semantic meaning.\nMRPCMicrosoft Research Paraphrase Corpus consists of sentence pairs automatically extracted from online news sources, with human annotationsfor whether the sentences in the pair are semantically equivalent (Dolan and Brockett, 2005).\nRTERecognizing Textual Entailment is a binary entailment task similar to MNLI, but with much less training data (Bentivogli et al., 2009).14\nWNLIWinograd NLI is a small natural language inference dataset (Levesque et al., 2011).The GLUE webpage notes that there are issues with the construction of this dataset, 15 and every trained system that’s been submitted to GLUE has performed worse than the 65.1 baseline accuracy of predicting the majority class. We therefore exclude this set to be fair to OpenAI GPT. For our GLUE submission, we always predicted the majority class.\nCAdditional Ablation Studies\nC.1Effect of Number of Training Steps\nFigure 5 presents MNLI Dev accuracy after fne-i tuning from a checkpoint that has been pre-trained for $k$  steps. This allows us to answer the following questions:\n1.Question:Does BERT really need such a large amount of pre-training (128,000 words/batch * 1,000,000 steps) to achieve high fne-tuning accuracy?i Answer: Yes, BERTBASE achieves almost $1.0\\%$ additional accuracy on MNLI when trained on 1M steps compared to 500k steps.\n2.Question: Does MLM pre-training converge slower than LTR pre-training, since only $15\\%$ of words are predicted in each batch rather than every word?Answer: The MLM model does converge slightly slower than the LTR model. However, in terms of absolute accuracy the MLM model begins to outperform the LTR model almost immediately.\nC.2Ablation for Different Masking Procedures\nIn Section 3.1, we mention that BERT uses a mixed strategy for masking the target tokens when pre-training with the masked language model(MLM) objective. The following is an ablation study to evaluate the effect of different masking strategies.\nFigure 5: Ablation over number of training steps. This shows the MNLI accuracy after fne-tuning, startingi from model parameters that have been pre-trained for k steps. The $x$ -axis is the value of k.\nNote that the purpose of the masking strategies is to reduce the mismatch between pre-training and fne-tuning, as the [MASK] symbol never ap-i pears during the fne-tuning stage. We report thei Dev results for both MNLI and NER. For NER,we report both fne-tuning and feature-based ap-i proaches, as we expect the mismatch will be amplifed for the feature-based approach as the modeli will not have the chance to adjust the representations.\n\n\n<html><body><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Masking Rates</td><td colspan=\"3\">Dev Set Results</td></tr><tr><td>MASK SAME</td><td></td><td>RND</td><td>MNLI Fine-tune </td><td></td><td>NER Fine-tune Feature-based</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> $80\\%$ </td><td> $10\\%$ </td><td> $10\\%$ </td><td>84.2</td><td>95.4</td><td>94.9</td></tr><tr><td> $100\\%$ </td><td> $0\\%$ </td><td> $0\\%$ </td><td>84.3</td><td>94.9</td><td>94.0</td></tr><tr><td> $80\\%$ </td><td> $0\\%$ </td><td> $20\\%$ </td><td>84.1</td><td>95.2</td><td>94.6</td></tr><tr><td> $80\\%$ </td><td> $20\\%$ </td><td> $0\\%$ </td><td>84.4</td><td>95.2</td><td>94.7</td></tr><tr><td> $0\\%$ </td><td> $20\\%$ </td><td> $80\\%$ </td><td>83.7</td><td>94.8</td><td>94.6</td></tr><tr><td> $0\\%$ </td><td> $0\\%$ </td><td> $100\\%$ </td><td>83.6</td><td>94.9</td><td>94.6</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>\n\nTable 8: Ablation over different masking strategies.\nThe results are presented in Table 8. In the table,MASK means that we replace the target token with the [MASK] symbol for MLM; SAME means that we keep the target token as is; RND means that we replace the target token with another random token.\nThe numbers in the left part of the table represent the probabilities of the specifc strategies usedi during MLM pre-training (BERT uses $80\\%,10\\%,$  $10\\%$ . The right part of the paper represents the Dev set results. For the feature-based approach,we concatenate the last 4 layers of BERT as the features, which was shown to be the best approach in Section 5.3.\nFrom the table it can be seen that fne-tuning isi surprisingly robust to different masking strategies.However, as expected, using only the MASK strategy was problematic when applying the featurebased approach to NER. Interestingly, using only the RND strategy performs much worse than our strategy as well.\n"}
