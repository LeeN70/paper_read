The ultimate ambition, often associated with Artifcial Generali Intelligence (AGI), is to create models with human-level cognitive capabilities across diverse domains.This requires a unifed mastery of complex problem-solving, generalization, and self-improvement,i moving beyond task-specifc excellence.i\n\nAs LLMs become more integrated into real-world scenarios, the key to enhancing actual productivity and solving complex professional tasks lies in developing specifc core capabilities. We identifyi three critical, interconnected capabilities as the measure of a truly generalist model: Agentic abilities for interacting with external tools and the real world; complex Reasoning for solving multi-step problems in domains like mathematics and science; and advanced Coding skills for tackling realworld software engineering tasks. While state-of-the-art proprietary models like OpenAI’s o1/o3 [18]and Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4 have demonstrated groundbreaking performance in specifc ARCi domains (e.g., mathematical reasoning or code fxing [20]), a single, powerful open-source modeli that excels across all three areas has remained elusive.\n\nThis paper introduces two new models: GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.5-Air, toward the goal of unifying all the different capabilities. The new models outperform existing open-source LLM models [13; 34; 47]across the board, with signifcant gains in agentic, reasoning, and coding tasks. GLM-4.5 and GLM-i 4.5-Air both feature hybrid reasoning modes: thinking mode for complex reasoning and agentic tasks, and non-thinking mode for instant responses. GLM-4.5 is our frst MoE model, with 355Bi total parameters and 32B activated parameters. GLM-4.5 demonstrates strong performance on the following ARC benchmarks:\n\nAgentic: GLM-4.5 scores $70.1\\%$ on TAU-Bench and $77.8\\%$ on BFCL v3 [26], on par with Claude Sonnet 4. For web browsing agents, GLM-4.5 scores $26.4\\%$ on BrowseComp [45], clearly outperforming Claude Opus 4 $\\widetilde{[18.8\\%)}$  and close to o4-mini-high $(28.3\\%$ .\n\nReasoning: GLM-4.5 demonstrates outstanding performance on a suite of challenging reasoning benchmarks, achieving $91.0\\%$ on AIME 24, $79.1\\%$ on GPQA [30], $72.9\\%$ on LiveCodeBench(2407-2501) [19], and $14.4\\%$ on HLE (Humanity’s Last Exam) [28].\n\nCoding: GLM-4.5 scores $64.2\\%$  on SWE-bench Verifed [20] andi $37.5\\%$ on Terminal-Bench [35],outperforming GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.5-pro, close to Claude Sonnet 4.\n\nGLM-4.5-Air is a smaller MoE model with 106B parameters. It represents a signifcant leap amongi models at the 100B scale, matching or exceeding Qwen3-235B-A22B [47] and MiniMax-M1 [7].\n\nIn Figure 1, we show the average performance on 12 benchmarks across agentic, reasoning, and coding (ARC) tasks. Overall, GLM-4.5 is ranked in the 3rd place and GLM-4.5-Air is ranked in the 6th. On agentic tasks, GLM-4.5 is ranked in the 2nd place, following OpenAI o3. On coding tasks, GLM-4.5 is ranked in the third place, close to Claude Sonnet 4. Note that GLM-4.5 is highly parameter-effcient, with only half the parameters of DeepSeek-R1 [13] and one-third those of Kimii K2 [34]. In Figure 2, we report the scores on SWE-bench Verifed vs model parameters of differenti open-source models, where GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.5-Air lie on the Pareto Frontier. More evaluation results are detailed in Section 4.\n\nBoth GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.5-Air are available on Z.ai, BigModel.cn, and also as open-source models on https://huggingface.co/zai-org/GLM-4.5. We also open-sourced an evaluation toolkit at https://github.com/zai-org/glm-simple-evals to ensure the reproducibility of our benchmark results.\n\n## 2Pre-Training\n\n## 2.1Architecture\n\nIn the GLM-4.5 series, we adopt the MoE architecture, which improves the computational effciencyi of both training and inference. We employ loss-free balance routing [40] and sigmoid gates for MoE layers [23]. Different from DeepSeek-V3 [23] and Kimi K2 [34], we reduce the width (hidden dimension and number of routed experts) of the model and increase its height (number of layers), as we found that deeper models exhibited better reasoning capacity. In the self-attention component,\n\n\n\n![4dea1da644c383228be3850d39432f61](imgs/4dea1da644c383228be3850d39432f61.jpg)\n\nFigure 2: SWE-bench verifed scores vs model parameters. Proprietary models are listed as unknowni at the right side.\n\nwe employ Grouped-Query Attention with partial RoPE. Furthermore, we utilize 2.5 times more attention heads (96 heads for a 5120 hidden dimension). Counterintuitively, while this increased head count does not improve training loss compared to models with fewer heads, it consistently improves performance on reasoning benchmarks such as MMLU and BBH. We also incorporate QK-Norm [15]to stabilize the range of attention logits. For both GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.5-Air, we add an MoE layer as the MTP (Multi-Token Prediction) layer [12] to support speculative decoding during inference.\n\nTable 1: Model architecture of GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.5-Air. When counting parameters, for GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.5-Air, we include the parameters of MTP layers but not word embeddings and the output layer.\n\n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Model</td><td>GLM-4.5</td><td>GLM-4.5-Air</td><td>DeepSeek-V3</td><td>Kimi K2</td></tr><tr><td># Total Parameters</td><td>355B</td><td>106B</td><td>671B</td><td>1043B</td></tr><tr><td># Activated Parameters</td><td>32B</td><td>12B</td><td>37B</td><td>32B</td></tr><tr><td># Dense Layers</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td># MoE Layers</td><td>89</td><td>45</td><td>58</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td># MTP Layers</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Hidden Dim</td><td>5120</td><td>4096</td><td>7168</td><td>7168</td></tr><tr><td>Dense Intermediate Dim</td><td>12288</td><td>10944</td><td>18432</td><td>18432</td></tr><tr><td>MoE Intermediate Dim</td><td>1536</td><td>1408</td><td>2048</td><td>2048</td></tr><tr><td>Attention Head Dim</td><td>128</td><td>128</td><td>192</td><td>192</td></tr><tr><td># Attention Heads</td><td>96</td><td>96</td><td>128</td><td>64</td></tr><tr><td># Key-Value Heads</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>128</td><td>64</td></tr><tr><td># Experts (total)</td><td>160</td><td>128</td><td>256</td><td>384</td></tr><tr><td># Experts Active Per Token</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td># Shared Experts</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>QK-Norm</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>No</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\n## 2.2Pre-Training Data\n\nOur pre-training corpus includes documents from webpages, social media, books, papers, and code repositories. We carefully design the data processing pipelines for different sources.\n\nWebThe majority of our pre-training documents are English and Chinese webpages crawled from the Internet. Inspired by Nemotron-CC [32], we divide the crawled webpages into buckets of different quality scores. We up-sample documents from the bucket with higher quality scores\n\n\n\n![5df7bd53c2122c93a8a25ffaafb9b652](imgs/5df7bd53c2122c93a8a25ffaafb9b652.jpg)\n\nFigure 3: Pre-training and mid-training stages for GLM-4.5. We adapt a multi-stage training recipe and extend the sequence length from 4K to 128K.\n\nand discard documents from the bucket with the lowest quality scores. The bucket with the highest quality scores contributes over 3.2 epochs during pre-training. In this way, the pre-training corpus can emphasize the high-frequency knowledge for reasoning tasks and also improve coverage for long-tail world knowledge. We have also found a large number of similar webpages automatically generated from templates and assigned high scores. Such webpages cannot be removed by MinHash deduplication. We additionally apply the SemDedup [1] pipeline to remove those similar webpages based on document embeddings.\n\nMultilingualTo support more natural languages, we include multilingual documents in our pretraining corpus. The multilingual corpus comes from both our crawled webpages and Fineweb-2 [27].We apply a quality classifer that judges the educational utility of documents and up-sample high-i quality multilingual documents.\n\nCodeWe curated source code data from GitHub and various code hosting platforms. The code corpus undergoes a preliminary rule-based fltering, followed by classifcation using language-specifciii quality models that categorize samples into three tiers: high-quality, medium-quality, and low-quality.During training, we up-sampled high-quality code while excluding low-quality samples. Moreover,the Fill-In-the-Middle [5] training objective is applied to all source code data. For code-related web documents, we employ a two-stage retrieval process from our text pre-training corpus. Documents are initially selected based on two criteria: presence of HTML code tags, or identifcation by ai FastText [22] classifer trained to detect code-related content. Subsequently, the retrieved documentsi undergo quality assessment using a dedicated model that classifes them into high-, medium-, ori low-quality categories, following the same quality-based sampling strategy for source code. Finally,a fne-grained parser is employed to re-parse the selected web pages to better preserve the formatsi and contents of the code.\n\nMath $\\&$  ScienceTo enhance the reasoning capacity, we collect documents related to mathematics and science from webpages, books, and papers. We apply a large language model to score candidate documents based on the ratio of educational content about mathematics and science, and train a small-scale classifer to predict the scores. Documents in the pre-training corpus with scores above ai certain threshold are up-sampled.\n\nThe pre-training process of GLM-4.5 is divided into two stages. In the frst stage, the model is mainlyi trained on general documents from webpages. During the second stage, we up-sample the source code from GitHub and webpages related to coding, mathematics, and science.\n\n## 2.3Mid-Training: Boost Reasoning & Agentic Capacity\n\nAfter pre-training, we add several stages to further boost the model’s performance on important application areas. Unlike traditional pre-training on large-scale general documents, these training stages utilize medium-size domain-specifc datasets, including instruction data. Therefore, we denotei these training stages as mid-training, which includes the following.\n\nRepo-level Code TrainingAt this training stage, we add concatenated code fles from the samei repository to learn cross-fle dependency. To improve the model’s software engineering capability,iwe also include model-fltered issues, pull requests (PRs), and commits from GitHub, with relatedi issues, PRs, and commits concatenated into one context and commits organized in a diff-like format.We extend the training sequence length from 4K to 32K to incorporate large repositories.\n\nSynthetic Reasoning Data TrainingAt this stage, we add synthetic reasoning content for math,science, and coding competitions. We collect a large number of questions and answers related to the reasoning tasks from webpages and books, and synthesize reasoning processes with a reasoning model.\n\nLong-context $\\&$  Agent TrainingTo further boost the model’s long-context performance, we extend the training sequence length from 32K to 128K and up-sample long documents from the pre-training corpus. Large-scale synthetic agent trajectories are also incorporated at this stage.\n\nIn Figure 3, we show the complete stages for pre-training and mid-training. The maximum sequence length is kept at 4,096 in pre-training, and is extended from 32,768 to 131,072 in mid-training. During pre-training, we did not use best-ft packing [11] since random truncation is a good data-augmentationi strategy for pre-training documents. For datasets in mid-training, we applied best-ft packing to avoidi truncating the reasoning process or repo-level code.\n\n## 2.4Hyper-Parameters\n\nWe employed the Muon optimizer [21; 24] for all parameters except word embedding, bias, and weights for RMSNorm. For hyperparameters, we set the Newton-Schulz iteration steps $N$ to 5,momentum $\\mu$  to 0.95, and scaled Muon’s update RMS to 0.2. We observed that the Muon optimizer can accelerate convergence and tolerate larger batch sizes. We used cosine decay schedule for learning rate, instead of warmup-stable-decay (WSD) schedule [17]. Our early experiments showed that models trained with the WSD schedule perform worse on general benchmarks (SimpleQA, MMLU),indicating underftting in the stable stage. The learning rate went through a warm-up stage from 0 toi 2.5e-4 and a decaying stage to 2.5e-5 until the end of mid-training. We used a batch size warmup strategy, where the batch size was gradually increased from 16M tokens to 64M tokens in the training of the frst 500B tokens, and remained constant in the remaining of training. For regularization, wei set the weight decay ratio to 0.1 and did not use dropout. We set the maximum sequence length to 4,096 during pre-training, and extended it to 32,768 and 131,072 during the mid-training stage as shown in Figure 3. When extending the sequence length to 32K, we also adjusted RoPE’s base frequency from 10,000 to 1,000,000 for better long-context modeling ability. For loss-free balance routing, we set the bias update rate to 0.001 for the frst 15T tokens, and to 0.0 for the remainingi tokens. We also applied auxiliary sequence-level balance loss with a 0.0001 weight to avoid extreme imbalance within any single sequence. The MTP loss weight λ was set to 0.3 for the frst 15T tokens,i and to 0.1 for the remaining tokens.\n\n## 3Post-Training: Expert Model Iteration\n\nWe divide the post-training process into two distinct stages. In stage 1 (Expert Training), we construct expert models specializing in three domains: Reasoning, Agent, and General chat. In stage 2 (Unifedi Training), we employ self-distillation techniques to integrate multiple experts, ultimately delivering a comprehensive model capable of generating responses through both deliberative reasoning and direct response modes.\n\n## 3.1Supervised Fine-Tuning\n\nWe perform Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) at the beginning of both Stage 1 (Expert Training) and Stage 2 (Unifed Training). In the expert training stage, the primary role of SFT is to provide a coldi start, empowering the model with basic chat, reasoning, and tool-use capabilities, which can then be further enhanced in subsequent expert RL training to achieve improved performance. In the unifedi training stage, the purpose of SFT is to distill the capabilities of different expert models into one hybrid reasoning generalist capable of handling different types of tasks.\n\n\n\nCold Start SFTDuring the cold-start phase, we utilize a small set of supervised fne-tuning (SFT)i data with extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) responses. This approach ensures that each expert model possesses adequate foundational ability prior to the reinforcement learning phase.\n\nOverall SFTIn the Overall SFT stage, we collect millions of samples covering reasoning tasks(math, code, science, etc.), general chat (writing, translation, summarization, chit chat, etc.), agentic tasks (basic tool using, coding ability especially for authentic project development, etc.), and longcontext understanding tasks from the previously trained expert models, and train the base model with a maximum context length of 128K tokens. By distilling from the output of distinct experts,the model learns to apply the most effective long CoT reasoning for each task to arrive at accurate answers. Especially, recognizing that a prolonged thinking process is unnecessary for certain domains that demand quick responses (such as chit chat), we meticulously balanced training data containing full reasoning with data lacking explicit thought processes. This approach allows the model to operate in both the refective and immediate response modes, thereby creating a hybrid reasoning model.l Moreover, we fnd the following strategy helpful in preparing SFT data to derive optimal performance.i\n\nReducing Character Escaping in Function Call TemplatesAlthough function call parameters are predominantly represented in JSON format in contemporary implementations, a signifcant challengei emerges when these parameters contain code segments. In such cases, a substantial proportion of characters within the code require escaping, compelling the model to generate extensive escape characters, thereby increasing the learning burden for the model. While this issue poses minimal concern for models primarily designed for general chat, it represents a non-trivial challenge for agentic foundation models where function calling is a core capability. To mitigate this limitation,we propose a novel function call template that encapsulates function call keys and values within XML-like special token tags. This approach substantially reduces the necessity for character escaping in code segments, as the vast majority of code can be represented in its native form without escaping.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed function call template does not compromise the performance of function call execution while recucing escaping. The following example (Figure 4)illustrates the structure of our proposed function call template. Detailed code implementation can be found in our open-source repository.\n\n<|system|>\n\n# Tools\n\nYou may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.\n\nYou are provided with function signatures within <tools></tools> XML tags:<tools>\n\n{\"name\": \"get_weather\", \"description\": \"Get the weather of a city for a specific date.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"city\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The city to get weather for,in Chinese.\"}, \"date\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The date in YYYY-MM-DD format.\"}}, \"required\":\n\n</tools>\n\nFor each function call, output the function name and arguments within the following XML format:\n\n<tool_call>{function-name}\n\n<arg_key>{arg-key-1}</arg_key>\n\n<arg_value>{arg-value-1}</arg_v\n\n<arg_key>{arg-key-2}</arg_key>\n\n<arg_value>{arg-value-2}</arg_value>\n\n</tool_call><|system|>\n\nYou are a helpful assistant.<|user|>\n\nToday is June 26, 2024.

We experimented with removing the prompts in the bottom $50\\%$ based on response lengths, resulting in a $2\\%\\text{-}4\\%$  improvement in math and science tasks, despite training with only half the data. Notably, we found that applying response scaling to these hard prompts can lead to further gains. Generating four responses for each prompt brought an additional $\\mathrm{\\bar{1}\\char37}\\text{-}2\\char37$  improvement.\n\nAutomatic Agentic SFT Data ConstructionThe construction of agentic SFT data involves four steps: 1. Agentic Framework and Tool Collection: We gather a set of agentic frameworks and real-world tool APIs and MCP servers, while also leveraging LLMs to automatically construct and simulate a batch of tools. 2. Task Synthesis: Based on these frameworks and tools, we automatically synthesize a collection of agentic tasks. On the one hand, for relatively mature frameworks, we leverage LLMs to comprehend their functionalities and automatically generate relevant queries or tasks. On the other hand, for more fragmented or disparate tools, we frst select a representativei subset and similarly employ LLMs to construct tasks about this subset. These tasks encompass both single-step and multi-step tool calling scenarios. 3. Trajectory Generation: For each synthesized task,we utilize existing LLMs to generate tool-call trajectories. Additionally, by employing the LLM as a user simulator, multi-step tool-call tasks are converted into trajectories involving multiple rounds of dialogue. 4. Quality Filtering: For each trajectory, multiple judge agents are used to evaluate whether the task is completed. Only successful trajectories are retained.\n\n## 3.2Reasoning RL\n\nReasoning RL focuses on enhancing a model’s capabilities in domains that demand logical deduction,structured problem-solving, and verifable accuracy. This includes critical areas such as mathematics,i code generation, and scientifc reasoning. A defning characteristic of these tasks is the high precisionii of their reward signals, as correctness can often be determined programmatically or with objective clarity. Mastery in these areas is not only crucial for advancing the raw intelligence of models but also serves as a fundamental building block for more complex, multi-step agentic behaviors.Recognizing the unique challenges and opportunities within reasoning RL, we have developed a suite of specialized techniques to effectively train our models. These methods, detailed below, are designed to address issues such as training effciency, sample diversity, and data quality. Our overalli RL algorithm builds upon the GRPO [31] framework, excluding the KL loss term. The comparison curves shown in this section are based on our smaller experimental model, not on GLM-4.5.\n\nDiffculty-based Curriculum LearningDuring reinforcement learning, the model’s profciencyii evolves, creating a mismatch with static training data. In the later stages, as the model becomes more capable, overly simple data can lead to rollouts where all rewards are 1s. Conversely, in the early stages, excessively diffcult data often results in batches where all rewards are 0s. In bothi\n\n\n\nAIME24 AVG@32: RL with Difficulty-based Curriculum Learning\n\n![b617a6ae43c3d5a9ccb2ead14dfde78d](imgs/b617a6ae43c3d5a9ccb2ead14dfde78d.jpg)\n\nFigure 5: Effectiveness of the two-stage diffculty-based curriculum on AIME’24. The blue linei(our method) switches to extremely diffcult problems (passi $@8{=}0,$  pass $\\rm\\rm\\char60512{>}0)$  in the second stage, showing continued improvement. The red line (baseline) continues with moderate-diffcultyi problems and plateaus.\n\n![c905354d492db388d694eda7d328a1d0](imgs/c905354d492db388d694eda7d328a1d0.jpg)\n\nFigure 6: Single-stage vs. multi-stage RL at 64K context length. The red line (single-stage at 64K) achieves superior performance. The blue line (multi-stage with progressively increasing length)suffers from an irreversible performance drop in early stages, limiting its fnal performance.i\n\nscenarios, the lack of reward variance provides no useful gradient signal, severely hindering training effciency. To address this challenge, we employ a two-stage diffculty-based curriculum for RL. Theii effectiveness of this and other strategies discussed below is validated through controlled experiments on a smaller model, which allows for rapid iteration and precise ablation studies. As shown in Figure 5, this two-stage approach enables the model to consistently surpass its performance ceiling.Crucially, to maintain high signal quality and reduce noise, all problems used in the second stage are strictly sourced from a pool with verifed correct answers.i\n\nSingle-Stage RL at 64K Output LengthPrevious research [25] has suggested conducting RL in multiple stages with progressively increasing maximum output lengths. However, our experiments reveal that this multi-stage approach is less effective than a single-stage RL process conducted directly at the maximum target length of 64K. Since the initial Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) has already conditioned the model on generating 64K-length responses, introducing RL stages with shorter maximum lengths can cause the model to “unlearn” its long-context capabilities. This often leads to a signifcant and irreversible drop in performance, as the model’s average output length decreases.i This degradation is diffcult to recover from in the fnal 64K-length RL stage, thus limiting furtherii improvement. Our experiments confrm this observation: as demonstrated in Figure 6, applying RLi directly at the full 64K-length continually pushes the model’s limits and yields better performance.\n\n\n\n![14eaf8bd007a0888eda0e923cf628549](imgs/14eaf8bd007a0888eda0e923cf628549.jpg)\n\nFigure 7: Ablation Studies for Code and Science RL. (Left) Comparison of loss calculation methods for code RL. The token-weighted mean loss approach achieves faster convergence compared to the sequence-mean loss baseline, accelerating the training process. (Right) Ablation on data sources for science RL on the GPQA-Diamond benchmark. Training exclusively on a small set of high-quality, expert-verifed multiple-choice questions yields the best performance, signifcantlyii outperforming training on mixed-quality data.\n\nDynamic Sampling TemperatureDuring RL, the sampling temperature is a key parameter for controlling trajectory diversity. A temperature that is too low leads to convergent, less exploratory outputs, while one that is too high introduces low-quality, noisy samples, undermining both model accuracy and training effciency. Using a fxed sampling temperature is suboptimal because it fails toii adapt as the policy distribution becomes more concentrated (i.e., has lower entropy), often resulting in insuffcient exploration at later stages. Therefore, we propose dynamically adjusting the samplingi temperature to maintain a healthy balance between accuracy and exploration. Specifcally, wheni the average reward of rollouts stabilizes, we identify this as a convergence phase and increase the sampling temperature to encourage greater diversity. To mitigate the risk of introducing excessive noise, we implement a quality-control mechanism: we periodically evaluate model performance on a held-out validation set across a range of temperatures. The temperature for the next training phase is then set to the maximum value that does not cause a performance drop of more than $1\\%$  from the current optimum [2].\n\nCode and Science RLCompared to mathematics, RL for coding and scientifc domains hasi received less attention in the literature. We conducted extensive controlled RL experiments in these areas and arrived at the following empirical conclusions. For code RL, we fnd that the choicei of loss calculation is critical for training effciency. As illustrated in Figure 7 (left), adopting ai token-weighted mean loss is highly benefcial compared to a conventional sequence-mean loss. Thei token-weighted approach provides a fner-grained and more stable gradient signal, which leads toi signifcantly faster convergence. This method also helps to alleviate the length bias inherent ini sequence-level rewards and effectively suppresses the generation of overly simplistic or repetitive“base case” samples during training. For science RL, our fndings on the GPQA-Diamond benchmarki highlight that data quality and type are paramount factors. As shown in Figure 7 (right), using exclusively expert-verifed multiple-choice questions for RL leads to signifcantly better performanceii compared to training with mixed-quality or unverifed data. This result underscores that even fori tasks with simple formats like multiple-choice, rigorously fltering the RL data pool to include onlyi high-quality, challenging instances is crucial for effective model improvement.\n\n## 3.3Agentic RL\n\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) helps language models follow human instructions more faithfully. Applying RL to math and programming contests has further uncovered strong reasoning abilities and favorable scaling behavior on tasks whose outcomes can be objectively verifed. Building on these insights, we focus on agentic settings—specifcally web-search andii code-generation agents—where every action or answer can be automatically checked. This built-in verifability supplies dense, reliable rewards, enabling us to scale RL training more effectively.i\n\n\n\n## 3.3.1Data Collection and Synthesis for Agents\n\nFor web-search tasks and open-domain information seeking, we develop a data-synthesis pipeline that yields demanding question–answer pairs requiring multi-step reasoning across multiple web sources. This corpus is designed to sharpen GLM’s ability to uncover elusive, interwoven facts on the internet. Dataset construction blends two approaches: (1) an automated pipeline powered by multi-hop reasoning over knowledge graphs, and (2) human-in-the-loop extraction and selective obfuscation of content from several web pages to prepare reinforcement-learning training signals.\n\nFor software-engineering tasks, we curate an extensive collection of GitHub pull requests and issues to create a realistic software-development benchmark comprising user prompts and executable unit tests. All evaluations run inside a hardened sandbox with a distributed system, which provides both horizontal scalability and strong isolation guarantees.\n\n## 3.3.2Pushing the Limits with Reinforcement Learning and Iterative Self-distillation\n\nWe adopt the group-wise policy optimization algorithm for RL training. For each problem x, we sample $K$ agent traces $\\{y_{1},\\ldots,y_{k}\\}$  from the previous policy $\\pi_{\\mathrm{old}},$  and optimize the model $\\pi_{\\theta}$  with respect to the following objective:\n\n$$L_{\\texttt{RL}}(\\theta)=\\mathbb{E}_{x\\sim\\mathcal{D}} \\left[\\frac{1}{K}\\sum_{i=1}^{K}\\left(r(x,y_{i})-\\bar{r}(x)\\right)\\right],$$\n\nwhere $\\begin{array}{c}\\bar{r}(x)=\\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{i=1}^{k}r\\big(x,y_{i} \\big)\\end{array}$ is the mean reward of the sampled responses. It is noted that only model-generated tokens are used for optimization, and the environment feedback is ignored in loss computation.\n\nOutcome Supervision with Process Action Format PenaltyFor web search tasks, we use the accuracy of the fnal answer as a reward for the entire agent trace. For coding agents, we primarilyi utilize SWE data with verifable test cases for RL training. Our experiments have shown that RLi training on web search and SWE tasks leads to generalized performance improvements across other tasks and benchmarks, such as general tool usage and coding tasks like Terminal-Bench. Additionally,we apply a process format penalty to ensure the model generates correct tool call formats. If the model fails to produce the correct tool format during agent trace generation, the process will be halted, and the trace will receive a zero reward.\n\nIterative DistillationSince RL training on agent tasks is time-consuming, we adopt a selfdistillation approach to iteratively enhance the performance of the SFT cold-start model before resuming RL training on this improved model. Specifcally, we frst perform RL training on theii initial cold-start model to boost agent performance. Once training has reached a certain step count or plateaued, we apply self-distillation by substituting the original cold-start data with responses generated by the RL-trained model, thus creating a superior SFT model. We then conduct further RL training on this enhanced model, progressively increasing training diffculty. This iterative strategyi allows us to push the performance limits of RL-trained models effciently.i\n\nScaling Test-time Compute via Interaction TurnsFor agent tasks, we observe signifcant perfor-i mance gains given increasing interaction turns with the environment. Compared to test-time scaling in reasoning models, which scales output tokens, agent tasks make use of test-time compute by continuously interacting with the environment, e.g., searching high and low for hard-to-fnd webi information or writing test cases for self-verifcation and self-correction for coding tasks. Figure 8i shows that with varying browsing effort, accuracy scales smoothly with test-time compute.\n\n## 3.4General RL\n\nGeneral RL aims to holistically improve the model’s overall performance, remediate potential issues,and strengthen key capabilities. Central to our methodology is a multi-source feedback system that synergizes rule-based feedback, human feedback (RLHF), and model-based feedback (RLAIF).This hybrid framework provides more robust training signals and allows us to leverage the unique advantages of each source: the precision of automated rules, the nuanced judgment of human annotators, and the scalability of AI-driven evaluation.\n\n\n\n![fa9ec6d50fc09a2eea7c018269c134fb](imgs/fa9ec6d50fc09a2eea7c018269c134fb.jpg)\n\nFigure 8: Interaction Turns Scaling for BrowseComp.\n\n![746cd498e9ce606619fda3ec5edaf33a](imgs/746cd498e9ce606619fda3ec5edaf33a.jpg)\n\nReward & SysBench Score During Instruction Following RL\n\nFigure 9: Training curve of Instruction Following RL without other General RL tasks. During GRPO training, the instruction following performance (SysBench-ISR) improves in step with the increasing reward. Up to roughly 1,000 training steps, we have not observed clear evidence of reward hacking.\n\nHolistic RLHolistic RL targets broad performance gains across diverse domains. To this end, we frst construct a balanced dataset of roughly 5,000 prompts spanning 7 primary, 33 secondary, andi 139 tertiary categories. Reward signals for Holistic RL are derived from both human and AI feedback.For human feedback, we train a reward model on preference annotations. Annotators compare model responses and assign preference labels based on a comprehensive evaluation of multiple dimensions,such as instruction following, safety, and factual correctness. For model feedback, we design separate scoring rubrics that depend on whether the prompt has an objective ground-truth answer. Merging the two feedback sources yields more reliable and expressive reward signals, mitigating the inherent limitations of each individual method.\n\nInstruction Following RLInstruction Following RL improves the model’s ability to understand and satisfy complex instructions. To achieve this, we create a fne-grained taxonomy with 7 major andi 151 minor constraint types, covering content requirements, formatting rules, and more. Based on this taxonomy, a dedicated training set of challenging instructions is assembled to cover every constraint type. The feedback system consists of deterministic verifcation rules, a trained reward model, and ai critique model. The robustness of this hybrid feedback system proves crucial during GRPO training.We observe mitigated reward hacking, enabling the policy model to achieve continuous and steady improvements in instruction following as shown in Figure 9.\n\nFunction Calling RLFunction Calling RL is divided into step-wise rule-based RL and end-to-end multi-turn RL. We incorporate step-wise rule-based RL directly into our general RL framework dueto their similar output lengths and convergence speeds. For end-to-end multi-turn RL, we frst traini specialized expert models and then distill these experts into the main model.\n\nStep-wise Rule-based RL: For tasks with clear tool invocation procedures, we annotate the ground truth function call for each step/turn in the training data. Given the task and the function calls from previous steps/turns, the model is trained to generate the next assistant response, which can be a function call or a response to the user. Using rule-based rewards, we guide the model to make correct function calls over consecutive rounds. Accordingly, we design the following strict reward function:\n\n$$\\mathrm{Reward}=\\left\\{\\begin{aligned} & 1,&&\\mathrm{if} \\mathtt{FormalCorrect}(a_{t}) \\mathrm{and} \\mathtt{Match}(a_{t},a_{t}^{*})\\\\ & 0,&&\\mathrm{otherwise}\\end{aligned}\\right.$$\n\nHere, $a_{t}$ denotes the t-th function call generated by the model, and $a_{t}^{*}$ is the corresponding ground truth function call. A reward of 1 is only given if $a_{t}$  is in the correct format and matches the ground truth exactly (including the name, parameters, and every feld). Otherwise, the reward isi 0. Such a strict reward rule not only guides the model to generate correct function calls but also strongly enforces output formatting, improving the model’s usability and robustness in real-world interactions.\n\nEnd-to-end Multi-turn RL: Step-wise rule-based RL decomposes tasks into static, predetermined decision fows. In this process, the model lacks dynamic interactions with the environment andl cannot autonomously explore, plan, or handle complex situations, thereby making its real-world problem-solving ability limited. To address these issues, we introduce end-to-end multi-turn function calling RL, where the model frst generates the complete trajectory and is then rewardedi based on task completion. In this way, the model can optimize its action policy through continuous trial and error with tool feedback, signifcantly enhancing its ability in autonomous planning andi decision-making. Specifcally, end-to-end multi-turn function calling RL considers two types ofi complex tasks: 1. single-turn multi-step tasks: The model needs to make multi-step function calls and interact with the environment to complete such tasks. We use complex tasks automatically synthesized based on MCP servers, as well as some open-source agentic datasets with runnable environments, such as Agentgym [46]. 2. multi-turn multi-step tasks: Besides interacting with the tool execution environment, the model also needs to interact with an LLM-simulated user agent to obtain complete task information and accomplish the overall task. The reward for end-to-end multi-turn function calling RL is computed as:\n\nHere, $I$ refers to the original complex task, $a_{t}$ is the t-th function call, and $o_{t}$  is the tool feedback or user information. TaskComplet $\\mathtt{ed}(I,o_{0},a_{1},o_{1},\\ldots,a_{T},o_{T})$  indicates whether the task is completed, which is determined by the environment according to predefned rules or by an LLMi Judge Agent.\n\nPathology RLAs the fnal stage of post-training, general RL needs to rectify potential issues,i such as language mixing, excessive repetition, and formatting mistakes. Although penalizing such behaviors in the above-mentioned general RL tasks is effective, the low incidence rate of these pathologies (often less than $1\\%$  of outputs) makes this a sample-ineffcient optimization strategy.i Therefore, we curate a targeted dataset for pathology RL by identifying prompts that are highly likely to trigger these pathological behaviors. Training on this dataset lets us impose effcient penalties,i further lowering the residual error rates for these problematic behaviors.\n\n## 3.5RL Infrastructure\n\nOur RL infrastructure is built upon Slime1, an open-source framework we developed. The framework is engineered with several key optimizations to enhance fexibility, effciency, and extensibility.li\n\nFlexible Hybrid Training and Data Generation ArchitectureA core feature of our infrastructure is its support for highly fexible training paradigms and data generation strategies within a single,l unifed system. This design allows us to cater to the distinct requirements of various RL tasks byi\n\n\n\n![e973bba50978ac2e8f1dd42a123d8e57](imgs/e973bba50978ac2e8f1dd42a123d8e57.jpg)\n\nFigure 10: Overview of the Slime RL infrastructure. The system consists of three core modules:Training (Megatron) – handles the main training process, reads data from the Data Buffer, and synchronizes parameters with the rollout module after training; Rollout (SGLang + Router) –generates new data, including rewards and verifer outputs, and writes it to the Data Buffer; Datai Buffer – serves as a bridge module that manages prompt initialization, custom data, and rollout generation strategies.\n\nsupporting both a colocated, synchronous mode and a disaggregated, asynchronous mode. This fexibility in data generation is crucial for extending our RL capabilities to new domains and morel complex agentic environments. We observed that different RL tasks beneft from different schedulingi approaches. For general-purpose RL tasks or those aimed at enhancing model reasoning capabilities(e.g., in mathematics and code generation), a synchronous, colocated architecture is more effective. In this setup, the training and inference engines reside on the same worker. This, combined with dynamic sampling, signifcantly reduces GPU idle time and maximizes resource utilization. Conversely, fori agentic tasks, such as those in Software Engineering (SWE), the data generation process is often protracted and involves complex system interactions. To ensure that the agent environments can operate continuously and maximize data throughput, we adopt a disaggregated, asynchronous model.The rollout component of the RL framework is exposed directly to the agent environment, while the GPUs for training and inference are scheduled independently. This decoupling enables the agent environments to constantly generate new data without being stalled by the training cycle. By leveraging the resource scheduling and asynchronous capabilities of the Ray framework, we can fexibly place the inference and training engines on the same GPU or on different ones. This duall support for synchronous and asynchronous training allows diverse RL tasks to share a common set of underlying optimizations for both training and inference.\n\nAccelerated Rollout with Mixed-Precision InferenceRollout effciency is a persistent bottlenecki in RL training. To address this, our infrastructure supports BF16 for training while leveraging FP8 for inference to accelerate the data generation phase. During each policy update iteration, we perform online, block-wise FP8 quantization on the model parameters before they are dispatched for rollout.This dynamic quantization enables highly effcient FP8 inference, signifcantly improving the overallii throughput of the data collection process.\n\nAgent-oriented RL Infra DesignTo conduct RL for agent tasks, we design a fully asynchronous and decoupled RL infrastructure that effciently handles long-horizon agent rollouts and supportsi fexible multi-task RL training across diverse agent frameworks.l\n\nAgentic rollouts often require prolonged interactions with complex environments, which can signif-i cantly slow down the overall RL training process. To overcome this, we frst design a high-concurrencyi Docker-based runtime that provisions isolated environments for each task, drastically reducing rollout overhead. In addition, we implement a fully asynchronous RL training loop. Because agent tasks can vary in type and trajectory length, synchronous RL training often leads to severe GPU underutilization as workers wait for the slowest rollouts to complete. Our approach partitions GPUs into dedicated rollout engines and training engines: the rollout engines continuously generate trajectories, while the training engines update the model weights and periodically synchronize them back to the rollout engines. This decoupled design prevents long or diverse trajectories from blocking the entire trainingpipeline, resulting in consistently high throughput, particularly in scenarios with highly variable agent interactions.\n\nAnother key challenge is the diversity of existing agent frameworks, which are tailored to different tasks. Leveraging these frameworks not only improves task-specifc performance but also maintainsi alignment between training and inference. To achieve this, we introduce a unifed HTTP endpointi interface coupled with a centralized data pool. Since most agent frameworks produce rollouts in a message-list format, all trajectories are stored in this data pool, which serves as a shared source for training. This architecture cleanly decouples task-specifc rollout logic from the RL training process,i enabling seamless integration of heterogeneous agent frameworks. Furthermore, the data pool supports customizable, task-specifc fltering and dynamic sampling strategies to ensure high-qualityii RL training data across diverse tasks.\n\nThrough these two core designs, our system provides a scalable, fexible, and high-performancel solution for long-agentic RL, and can support long-horizon rollouts and adapt to a wide range of agent tasks.\n\n## 4Evaluation\n\n## 4.1Evaluation of Base Models\n\nWe frst evaluate the performance of our base model GLM-4.5-Base.

On average, GLM-4.5 is the best competitor for Claude Sonnet 4 on coding tasks.\n\n4.2.4Evaluation of General Abilities\n\nTable 6: Results on Commonly Used General Chat Benchmarks\n\n\n\n<html><body><table><thead><tr><td>Benchmark</td><td>GLM- 4.5</td><td>GLM- 4.5-Air</td><td>GPT-4.1</td><td>Claude Sonnet 4</td><td>Gemini 2.5 Pro</td><td>Grok 4</td><td>Qwen3 235B</td><td>Deepseek R1 0528</td><td>DeepSeek V3 0324</td><td>Kimi K2</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>MMLU</td><td>90.0</td><td>87.4</td><td>90.2</td><td>91.9</td><td>91.9</td><td>91.9</td><td>90.2</td><td>89.9</td><td>89.1</td><td>89.5</td></tr><tr><td>SimpleQA</td><td>26.4</td><td>14.5</td><td>42.3</td><td>18.5</td><td>54.0</td><td>51.9</td><td>45.8</td><td>27.8</td><td>27.7</td><td>31.0</td></tr><tr><td>IFEval</td><td>86.1</td><td>86.3</td><td>87.4</td><td>88.7</td><td>90.8</td><td>92.4</td><td>87.8</td><td>80.0</td><td>83.4</td><td>89.8</td></tr><tr><td>SysBench</td><td>81.0</td><td>77.4</td><td>80.6</td><td>80.6</td><td>82.2</td><td>81.5</td><td>83.3</td><td>81.2</td><td>79.8</td><td>79.0</td></tr><tr><td>MultiChallenge</td><td>52.8</td><td>42.5</td><td>38.3</td><td>55.3</td><td>57.5</td><td>65.2</td><td>58.2</td><td>46.5</td><td>37.0</td><td>54.1</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>\n\nTo evaluate the model’s general abilities, we employed a set of widely-adopted open-source benchmark datasets, encompassing knowledge-intensive evaluations MMLU (EM) [14] and SimpleQA (Correct) [44], and instruction-following assessments IFEval (Prompt Strict) [52], SysBench (ISR) [29],and MultiChallenge [10]. MultiChallenge is a multi-turn conversational benchmark evaluating LLMs across four integrated capability dimensions. SysBench systematically evaluates LLMs’ system message following capabilities across multi-turn conversations through three-level granularity metrics.On the MMLU benchmark, nearly all fagship models, including GLM-4.5, demonstrate performancel at a comparable level. SimpleQA, which refects the factual knowledge of a model, shows thatl GLM-4.5 (355B) performs similarly to DeepSeek V3 and R1 (both 671B), despite having nearly half of the parameters. On the IFEval benchmark, GLM-4.5 outperforms DeepSeek R1. In the Sysbench evaluation, GLM-4.5 surpasses GPT-4.1, DeepSeek V3, and Kimi K2. Additionally, on the MultiChallenge benchmark, it demonstrates superior performance compared to both GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek R1.\n\n## 4.2.5Evaluation of Safety\n\nTo systematically assess the safety alignment of our model, we utilized SafetyBench [51], a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety of large language models. SafetyBench consists of 11,435 multiple-choice questions covering seven distinct categories of safety concerns, with data in both English and Chinese. This benchmark enables a standardized and scalable evaluation of a model’s ability to handle potentially harmful or sensitive topics. The categories include Ethics and Morality, Illegal Activities, Mental Health, Offensiveness, Physical Health, Privacy and Property, and Unfairness and Bias. We evaluated GLM-4.5 against a suite of other leading models. The results indicate that GLM-4.5 achieves a strong safety score, competitive with other top-tier models. Its overall score of 89.87 is comparable to that of Kimi-K2 (90.48) and GPT-4.1 (89.71). Notably,GLM-4.5 demonstrates robust performance in the areas of Ethics and Morality (94.33), Mental Health(94.67), and Physical Health (96.67). While it performs well in preventing responses related to Illegal Activities (90.97) and protecting Privacy and Property (92.00), there is still room for improvement in addressing Unfairness and Bias, an area of ongoing focus for our development efforts. The detailed performance breakdown is presented in the table below.\n\n## 4.3Evaluations for Hands-on Experience\n\nSometimes, a trained LLM may overft some predefned benchmarks, which makes the evaluatedii results not precisely refect real-world experience. To overcome this challenge and to gauge ourl model’s performance in more realistic situations, we have established a comprehensive manual evaluation framework. Human evaluation is particularly advantageous for assessing performance on open-ended questions, where aspects like coherence, relevance, and creativity are paramount.This hands-on approach allows for a more granular analysis, enabling us to better pinpoint areas of weakness and understand the qualitative aspects of model behavior that automated metrics often miss.\n\n\n\nTable 7: Evaluation Results on SafetyBench\n\n\n\n<html><body><table><thead><tr><td>Model</td><td>Average </td><td>Ethics & Morality</td><td>Illegal Activities</td><td>Mental Health</td><td> Offensiveness </td><td>Health</td><td>PhysicalPrivacy & Property</td><td>Unfairness & Bias</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>GLM-4.5</td><td>89.9</td><td>94.3</td><td>91.0</td><td>94.7</td><td>83.0</td><td>96.7</td><td>92.0</td><td>77.4</td></tr><tr><td>GLM-4.5-Air</td><td>87.8</td><td>91.0</td><td>90.3</td><td>92.7</td><td>83.3</td><td>92.3</td><td>90.3</td><td>74.7</td></tr><tr><td>Gemini 2.5 Pro</td><td>90.5</td><td>94.7</td><td>91.7</td><td>95.3</td><td>84.3</td><td>97.0</td><td>92.3</td><td>78.0</td></tr><tr><td>Kimi K2</td><td>90.5</td><td>93.0</td><td>93.3</td><td>95.0</td><td>90.3</td><td>97.3</td><td>93.0</td><td>71.3</td></tr><tr><td>GPT-4.1</td><td>89.7</td><td>92.0</td><td>94.3</td><td>95.3</td><td>85.3</td><td>95.7</td><td>91.3</td><td>74.0</td></tr><tr><td>DeepSeek-V3-0324</td><td>88.8</td><td>92.3</td><td>90.7</td><td>95.0</td><td>84.7</td><td>95.7</td><td>91.0</td><td>72.3</td></tr><tr><td>DeepSeek-R1-0528</td><td>83.5</td><td>87.0</td><td>81.7</td><td>86.7</td><td>77.7</td><td>92.0</td><td>85.7</td><td>73.7</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>\n\n## 4.3.1Evaluation of General Chat\n\nTo test the practical application capabilities of our models, we curated a diverse dataset of realscenario user prompts. These prompts span multiple languages and cover a wide range of categories,including Mathematics, Text Processing, Text Generation, Subjective QA, Objective QA, Logical Reasoning, and Code Instructions. We meticulously fltered this collection to ensure high quality andi appropriate diffculty, while also removing any data that could compromise user privacy or safety.i The fnal dataset consists of 660 prompts, with a distribution of 392 in English, 108 in Chinese, andi 160 in other languages. For prompts requiring factual knowledge, we annotated the correct answers to serve as a ground truth for evaluation.\n\nWe conducted a comparative evaluation between GLM-4.5, Deepseek-R1-0528, and Kimi K2. For each prompt, the responses from the different models were presented in a randomized order to eliminate any potential sequential bias. A single, consistent evaluator then scored each response on a scale of 0 to 10. This method of using the same evaluator at the same time for a batch of comparisons is designed to minimize deviations arising from different individual preferences and subjective standards. The reasoning contents of GLM-4.5 and Deepseek-R1-0528 are not presented to the evaluators. The average scores for each model across the different categories and languages are presented below.\n\nEnglish ResultsIn the English prompt set, GLM-4.5 achieved the highest overall score.

We compare GLM-4.5 against three strong baselines: Claude Sonnet 4, Kimi K2, and Qwen3-Coder. Each task was executed in an isolated containerized environment to prevent cross-task interference, with models initialized using predefned API confgurations. Testing was conducted interactively by human experts overii multiple rounds: each task began with a standardized prompt, followed by iterative interactions whereexperts adjusted inputs based on model outputs until the task was completed or failed. To ensure fairness, the same expert followed consistent interaction strategies across all models.\n\nBased on this testing procedure, model performance was evaluated using the following criteria:the primary metric was task completion, determined by predefned completion criteria. In casesi of ties, effciency and reliability—including tool calling success rate and token consumption eff-ii ciency—were used as secondary metrics. The evaluation prioritized functional correctness and task completion over effciency metrics, ensuring that coding capability remained the primary evaluationi focus.\n\nResultsIn head-to-head evaluations, GLM-4.5 demonstrated strong performance relative to opensource baselines and competitive capability against closed-source models as shown in fgure 12.i Specifcally:i\n\nGLM-4.5 vs Claude Sonnet 4: $40.4\\%$ win, $9.6\\%$ tie, $50.0\\%$ loss\n\nGLM-4.5 vs Kimi K2: $53.9\\%$ win, $17.3\\%$ tie, $28.8\\%$ loss\n\nGLM-4.5 vs Qwen3-Coder: $80.8\\%$ win, $7.7\\%$ tie, $11.5\\%$ loss\n\nAs shown in fgure 13, GLM-4.5 particularly excelled in tool calling reliability, achieving the highesti success rate at $\\mathbf{90.6\\%},$  compared to Claude Sonnet 4 $(89.5\\%),$  Kimi-K2 $(86.2\\%)$  and Qwen3-Coder(77.1%). While Claude Sonnet 4 remains a strong competitor, GLM-4.5 outperformed other models in both task completion consistency and agentic execution robustness.\n\n## 4.3.3Evaluation of Logical Reasoning\n\nTo rigorously assess the true logical reasoning capabilities of the models and mitigate the risk of data contamination from common logical questions found online, we constructed a new, challenging evaluation set. This set comprises novel and complex logical reasoning problems that are structurally different from those widely available on the internet. Each problem is designed to require multiple steps of logical deduction to arrive at the correct solution.\n\nFor this evaluation, we established a unifed and detailed scoring standard for each question. Wei then tasked each model with solving these problems. The correctness and quality of each model’s response were subsequently inspected and scored by human experts. The results show a competitive landscape, with GLM-4.5 performing on par with leading models.\n\nTable 11: Expert Evaluation Scores on Novel Logical Reasoning Problems\n\n\n\n<html><body><table><thead><tr><td>Model</td><td>Score</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gemini 2.5 Pro</td><td>65.8</td></tr><tr><td>DeepSeek-R1-0528</td><td>62.1</td></tr><tr><td>GLM-4.5</td><td>62.0</td></tr><tr><td>GLM-4.5-Air</td><td>53.4</td></tr><tr><td>Kimi K2</td><td>51.9</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>\n\n## 4.4Evaluation of Translation\n\nThe New Paradigm of TranslationTranslation today extends beyond simple text conversion to encompass a nuanced understanding of evolving internet slang, cultural context, and domain-specifci terminology:\n\nNetizen Lingo: Translating “yyds” accurately requires recognizing it as the acronym for the Chinese phrase “永远的神” (yoˇng yuaˇn de shén), meaning “the eternal god,” thus capturing its true sentiment of enthusiastic praise and admiration.\n\nDomain Nicknames: Recognizing “胖” (literally “fat white”) is critical within photography communities. Specialized models may translate it incorrectly, but a general-purpose model understands it as a widely used nickname for the “Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM” lens, providing precise translations.\n\n\n\nSymbols: When a Chinese user sends a “fsh” emoji in a conversation to refer to a second-handi marketplace, can the model understand the cultural meme behind it, which points to the “闲鱼”(Xiányú) platform? This tests the model’s cognitive ability to connect visual symbols with online cultural phenomena.\n\nDeep Contextual Reasoning: Translating “三花公主驾到,速来围观” demands identifying “三花”not as a person’s name but as a reference to the popular calico coloration of cats. A general-purpose model accurately deduces this context, translating the phrase idiomatically as “The Calico Princess has arrived! Come and see!”.\n\nThese examples underscore modern translation as a task rooted deeply in knowledge and reasoning.\n\nEvaluation ResultsWe tested 100 challenging, real-world cases commonly mistranslated by current tools, comparing GLM-4.5 against specialized translation models (Qwen-MT-plus, QwenMT-turbo, Seed-X [9]) in a blind human evaluation (scored 0-3 considering whether the meaning is conveyed correctly and whether the language is authentic). The results are shown in Table 12.\n\nTable 12: Human Scores on Selected Challenging Translation data\n\n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Model</td><td>Average Score</td></tr><tr><td>GLM-4.5</td><td>1.71</td></tr><tr><td>Qwen-MT-plus</td><td>0.38</td></tr><tr><td>Qwen-MT-turbo</td><td>0.55</td></tr><tr><td>Seed-X</td><td>0.65</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nGLM-4.5 signifcantly outperforms specialized models. For example, translating “三花公主驾到”i specialized models failed contextually, whereas GLM-4.5 accurately conveys the idiomatic meaning.\n\n## 5Conclusion\n\nIn this report, we have introduced the GLM-4.5 model series, including GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.5-Air.Both models adopt the MoE architecture, which improves the computational effciency compared toi previous GLM models. GLM-4.5 excels at reasoning, coding, and agentic tasks, ranked in 3rd place globally among open-source and proprietary models. We release the model weights of GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.5-Air to advance the applications and research of large language models.\n\n\n\n## 6Contribution\n\nContributors’ names are listed in alphabetical order by frst name.

Task Synthesis: Based on these frameworks and tools, we automatically synthesize a collection of agentic tasks. On the one hand, for relatively mature frameworks, we leverage LLMs to comprehend their functionalities and automatically generate relevant queries or tasks. On the other hand, for more fragmented or disparate tools, we frst select a representativei subset and similarly employ LLMs to construct tasks about this subset. These tasks encompass both single-step and multi-step tool calling scenarios. 3. Trajectory Generation: For each synthesized task,we utilize existing LLMs to generate tool-call trajectories.

This result underscores that even fori tasks with simple formats like multiple-choice, rigorously fltering the RL data pool to include onlyi high-quality, challenging instances is crucial for effective model improvement."},{"bbox":{"x0":208,"x1":366,"y0":1269,"y1":1300},"conf":0.8767,"font_size":0.0,"label":"Title","label_id":0,"lines":[{"bbox":{"x0":213,"x1":359,"y0":1272,"y1":1294},"font_size":0.0,"text":"3.3Agentic RL"}],"source":"layout det","text":"3.3Agentic RL"},{"bbox":{"x0":207,"x1":1017,"y0":1309,"y1":1452},"conf":0.9669,"font_size":0.0,"label":"Text","label_id":1,"lines":[{"bbox":{"x0":213,"x1":1009,"y0":1312,"y1":1335},"font_size":0.0,"text":"Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) helps language models follow human"},{"bbox":{"x0":213,"x1":1009,"y0":1335,"y1":1356},"font_size":0.0,"text":"instructions more faithfully.

The ultimate ambition, often associated with Artifcial Generali Intelligence (AGI), is to create models with human-level cognitive capabilities across diverse domains.This requires a unifed mastery of complex problem-solving, generalization, and self-improvement,i moving beyond task-specifc excellence.i\nAs LLMs become more integrated into real-world scenarios, the key to enhancing actual productivity and solving complex professional tasks lies in developing specifc core capabilities. We identifyi three critical, interconnected capabilities as the measure of a truly generalist model: Agentic abilities for interacting with external tools and the real world; complex Reasoning for solving multi-step problems in domains like mathematics and science; and advanced Coding skills for tackling realworld software engineering tasks. While state-of-the-art proprietary models like OpenAI’s o1/o3 [18]and Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4 have demonstrated groundbreaking performance in specifc ARCi domains (e.g., mathematical reasoning or code fxing [20]), a single, powerful open-source modeli that excels across all three areas has remained elusive.\nThis paper introduces two new models: GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.5-Air, toward the goal of unifying all the different capabilities. The new models outperform existing open-source LLM models [13; 34; 47]across the board, with signifcant gains in agentic, reasoning, and coding tasks. GLM-4.5 and GLM-i 4.5-Air both feature hybrid reasoning modes: thinking mode for complex reasoning and agentic tasks, and non-thinking mode for instant responses. GLM-4.5 is our frst MoE model, with 355Bi total parameters and 32B activated parameters. GLM-4.5 demonstrates strong performance on the following ARC benchmarks:\nAgentic: GLM-4.5 scores $70.1\\%$ on TAU-Bench and $77.8\\%$ on BFCL v3 [26], on par with Claude Sonnet 4. For web browsing agents, GLM-4.5 scores $26.4\\%$ on BrowseComp [45], clearly outperforming Claude Opus 4 $\\widetilde{[18.8\\%)}$  and close to o4-mini-high $(28.3\\%$ .\nReasoning: GLM-4.5 demonstrates outstanding performance on a suite of challenging reasoning benchmarks, achieving $91.0\\%$ on AIME 24, $79.1\\%$ on GPQA [30], $72.9\\%$ on LiveCodeBench(2407-2501) [19], and $14.4\\%$ on HLE (Humanity’s Last Exam) [28].\nCoding: GLM-4.5 scores $64.2\\%$  on SWE-bench Verifed [20] andi $37.5\\%$ on Terminal-Bench [35],outperforming GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.5-pro, close to Claude Sonnet 4.\nGLM-4.5-Air is a smaller MoE model with 106B parameters. It represents a signifcant leap amongi models at the 100B scale, matching or exceeding Qwen3-235B-A22B [47] and MiniMax-M1 [7].\nIn Figure 1, we show the average performance on 12 benchmarks across agentic, reasoning, and coding (ARC) tasks. Overall, GLM-4.5 is ranked in the 3rd place and GLM-4.5-Air is ranked in the 6th. On agentic tasks, GLM-4.5 is ranked in the 2nd place, following OpenAI o3. On coding tasks, GLM-4.5 is ranked in the third place, close to Claude Sonnet 4. Note that GLM-4.5 is highly parameter-effcient, with only half the parameters of DeepSeek-R1 [13] and one-third those of Kimii K2 [34]. In Figure 2, we report the scores on SWE-bench Verifed vs model parameters of differenti open-source models, where GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.5-Air lie on the Pareto Frontier. More evaluation results are detailed in Section 4.\nBoth GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.5-Air are available on Z.ai, BigModel.cn, and also as open-source models on https://huggingface.co/zai-org/GLM-4.5. We also open-sourced an evaluation toolkit at https://github.com/zai-org/glm-simple-evals to ensure the reproducibility of our benchmark results.\n2Pre-Training\n2.1Architecture\nIn the GLM-4.5 series, we adopt the MoE architecture, which improves the computational effciencyi of both training and inference. We employ loss-free balance routing [40] and sigmoid gates for MoE layers [23]. Different from DeepSeek-V3 [23] and Kimi K2 [34], we reduce the width (hidden dimension and number of routed experts) of the model and increase its height (number of layers), as we found that deeper models exhibited better reasoning capacity. In the self-attention component,\n\nFigure 2: SWE-bench verifed scores vs model parameters. Proprietary models are listed as unknowni at the right side.\nwe employ Grouped-Query Attention with partial RoPE. Furthermore, we utilize 2.5 times more attention heads (96 heads for a 5120 hidden dimension). Counterintuitively, while this increased head count does not improve training loss compared to models with fewer heads, it consistently improves performance on reasoning benchmarks such as MMLU and BBH. We also incorporate QK-Norm [15]to stabilize the range of attention logits. For both GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.5-Air, we add an MoE layer as the MTP (Multi-Token Prediction) layer [12] to support speculative decoding during inference.\nTable 1: Model architecture of GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.5-Air. When counting parameters, for GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.5-Air, we include the parameters of MTP layers but not word embeddings and the output layer.\n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Model</td><td>GLM-4.5</td><td>GLM-4.5-Air</td><td>DeepSeek-V3</td><td>Kimi K2</td></tr><tr><td># Total Parameters</td><td>355B</td><td>106B</td><td>671B</td><td>1043B</td></tr><tr><td># Activated Parameters</td><td>32B</td><td>12B</td><td>37B</td><td>32B</td></tr><tr><td># Dense Layers</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td># MoE Layers</td><td>89</td><td>45</td><td>58</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td># MTP Layers</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Hidden Dim</td><td>5120</td><td>4096</td><td>7168</td><td>7168</td></tr><tr><td>Dense Intermediate Dim</td><td>12288</td><td>10944</td><td>18432</td><td>18432</td></tr><tr><td>MoE Intermediate Dim</td><td>1536</td><td>1408</td><td>2048</td><td>2048</td></tr><tr><td>Attention Head Dim</td><td>128</td><td>128</td><td>192</td><td>192</td></tr><tr><td># Attention Heads</td><td>96</td><td>96</td><td>128</td><td>64</td></tr><tr><td># Key-Value Heads</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>128</td><td>64</td></tr><tr><td># Experts (total)</td><td>160</td><td>128</td><td>256</td><td>384</td></tr><tr><td># Experts Active Per Token</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td># Shared Experts</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>QK-Norm</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>No</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\n2.2Pre-Training Data\nOur pre-training corpus includes documents from webpages, social media, books, papers, and code repositories. We carefully design the data processing pipelines for different sources.\nWebThe majority of our pre-training documents are English and Chinese webpages crawled from the Internet. Inspired by Nemotron-CC [32], we divide the crawled webpages into buckets of different quality scores. We up-sample documents from the bucket with higher quality scores\n\nFigure 3: Pre-training and mid-training stages for GLM-4.5. We adapt a multi-stage training recipe and extend the sequence length from 4K to 128K.\nand discard documents from the bucket with the lowest quality scores. The bucket with the highest quality scores contributes over 3.2 epochs during pre-training. In this way, the pre-training corpus can emphasize the high-frequency knowledge for reasoning tasks and also improve coverage for long-tail world knowledge. We have also found a large number of similar webpages automatically generated from templates and assigned high scores. Such webpages cannot be removed by MinHash deduplication. We additionally apply the SemDedup [1] pipeline to remove those similar webpages based on document embeddings.\nMultilingualTo support more natural languages, we include multilingual documents in our pretraining corpus. The multilingual corpus comes from both our crawled webpages and Fineweb-2 [27].We apply a quality classifer that judges the educational utility of documents and up-sample high-i quality multilingual documents.\nCodeWe curated source code data from GitHub and various code hosting platforms. The code corpus undergoes a preliminary rule-based fltering, followed by classifcation using language-specifciii quality models that categorize samples into three tiers: high-quality, medium-quality, and low-quality.During training, we up-sampled high-quality code while excluding low-quality samples. Moreover,the Fill-In-the-Middle [5] training objective is applied to all source code data. For code-related web documents, we employ a two-stage retrieval process from our text pre-training corpus. Documents are initially selected based on two criteria: presence of HTML code tags, or identifcation by ai FastText [22] classifer trained to detect code-related content. Subsequently, the retrieved documentsi undergo quality assessment using a dedicated model that classifes them into high-, medium-, ori low-quality categories, following the same quality-based sampling strategy for source code. Finally,a fne-grained parser is employed to re-parse the selected web pages to better preserve the formatsi and contents of the code.\nMath $\\&$  ScienceTo enhance the reasoning capacity, we collect documents related to mathematics and science from webpages, books, and papers. We apply a large language model to score candidate documents based on the ratio of educational content about mathematics and science, and train a small-scale classifer to predict the scores. Documents in the pre-training corpus with scores above ai certain threshold are up-sampled.\nThe pre-training process of GLM-4.5 is divided into two stages. In the frst stage, the model is mainlyi trained on general documents from webpages. During the second stage, we up-sample the source code from GitHub and webpages related to coding, mathematics, and science.\n2.3Mid-Training: Boost Reasoning & Agentic Capacity\nAfter pre-training, we add several stages to further boost the model’s performance on important application areas. Unlike traditional pre-training on large-scale general documents, these training stages utilize medium-size domain-specifc datasets, including instruction data. Therefore, we denotei these training stages as mid-training, which includes the following.\nRepo-level Code TrainingAt this training stage, we add concatenated code fles from the samei repository to learn cross-fle dependency. To improve the model’s software engineering capability,iwe also include model-fltered issues, pull requests (PRs), and commits from GitHub, with relatedi issues, PRs, and commits concatenated into one context and commits organized in a diff-like format.We extend the training sequence length from 4K to 32K to incorporate large repositories.\nSynthetic Reasoning Data TrainingAt this stage, we add synthetic reasoning content for math,science, and coding competitions. We collect a large number of questions and answers related to the reasoning tasks from webpages and books, and synthesize reasoning processes with a reasoning model.\nLong-context $\\&$  Agent TrainingTo further boost the model’s long-context performance, we extend the training sequence length from 32K to 128K and up-sample long documents from the pre-training corpus. Large-scale synthetic agent trajectories are also incorporated at this stage.\nIn Figure 3, we show the complete stages for pre-training and mid-training. The maximum sequence length is kept at 4,096 in pre-training, and is extended from 32,768 to 131,072 in mid-training. During pre-training, we did not use best-ft packing [11] since random truncation is a good data-augmentationi strategy for pre-training documents. For datasets in mid-training, we applied best-ft packing to avoidi truncating the reasoning process or repo-level code.\n2.4Hyper-Parameters\nWe employed the Muon optimizer [21; 24] for all parameters except word embedding, bias, and weights for RMSNorm. For hyperparameters, we set the Newton-Schulz iteration steps $N$ to 5,momentum $\\mu$  to 0.95, and scaled Muon’s update RMS to 0.2. We observed that the Muon optimizer can accelerate convergence and tolerate larger batch sizes. We used cosine decay schedule for learning rate, instead of warmup-stable-decay (WSD) schedule [17]. Our early experiments showed that models trained with the WSD schedule perform worse on general benchmarks (SimpleQA, MMLU),indicating underftting in the stable stage. The learning rate went through a warm-up stage from 0 toi 2.5e-4 and a decaying stage to 2.5e-5 until the end of mid-training. We used a batch size warmup strategy, where the batch size was gradually increased from 16M tokens to 64M tokens in the training of the frst 500B tokens, and remained constant in the remaining of training. For regularization, wei set the weight decay ratio to 0.1 and did not use dropout. We set the maximum sequence length to 4,096 during pre-training, and extended it to 32,768 and 131,072 during the mid-training stage as shown in Figure 3. When extending the sequence length to 32K, we also adjusted RoPE’s base frequency from 10,000 to 1,000,000 for better long-context modeling ability. For loss-free balance routing, we set the bias update rate to 0.001 for the frst 15T tokens, and to 0.0 for the remainingi tokens. We also applied auxiliary sequence-level balance loss with a 0.0001 weight to avoid extreme imbalance within any single sequence. The MTP loss weight λ was set to 0.3 for the frst 15T tokens,i and to 0.1 for the remaining tokens.\n3Post-Training: Expert Model Iteration\nWe divide the post-training process into two distinct stages. In stage 1 (Expert Training), we construct expert models specializing in three domains: Reasoning, Agent, and General chat. In stage 2 (Unifedi Training), we employ self-distillation techniques to integrate multiple experts, ultimately delivering a comprehensive model capable of generating responses through both deliberative reasoning and direct response modes.\n3.1Supervised Fine-Tuning\nWe perform Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) at the beginning of both Stage 1 (Expert Training) and Stage 2 (Unifed Training). In the expert training stage, the primary role of SFT is to provide a coldi start, empowering the model with basic chat, reasoning, and tool-use capabilities, which can then be further enhanced in subsequent expert RL training to achieve improved performance. In the unifedi training stage, the purpose of SFT is to distill the capabilities of different expert models into one hybrid reasoning generalist capable of handling different types of tasks.\n\nCold Start SFTDuring the cold-start phase, we utilize a small set of supervised fne-tuning (SFT)i data with extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) responses. This approach ensures that each expert model possesses adequate foundational ability prior to the reinforcement learning phase.\nOverall SFTIn the Overall SFT stage, we collect millions of samples covering reasoning tasks(math, code, science, etc.), general chat (writing, translation, summarization, chit chat, etc.), agentic tasks (basic tool using, coding ability especially for authentic project development, etc.), and longcontext understanding tasks from the previously trained expert models, and train the base model with a maximum context length of 128K tokens. By distilling from the output of distinct experts,the model learns to apply the most effective long CoT reasoning for each task to arrive at accurate answers. Especially, recognizing that a prolonged thinking process is unnecessary for certain domains that demand quick responses (such as chit chat), we meticulously balanced training data containing full reasoning with data lacking explicit thought processes. This approach allows the model to operate in both the refective and immediate response modes, thereby creating a hybrid reasoning model.l Moreover, we fnd the following strategy helpful in preparing SFT data to derive optimal performance.i\nReducing Character Escaping in Function Call TemplatesAlthough function call parameters are predominantly represented in JSON format in contemporary implementations, a signifcant challengei emerges when these parameters contain code segments. In such cases, a substantial proportion of characters within the code require escaping, compelling the model to generate extensive escape characters, thereby increasing the learning burden for the model. While this issue poses minimal concern for models primarily designed for general chat, it represents a non-trivial challenge for agentic foundation models where function calling is a core capability. To mitigate this limitation,we propose a novel function call template that encapsulates function call keys and values within XML-like special token tags. This approach substantially reduces the necessity for character escaping in code segments, as the vast majority of code can be represented in its native form without escaping.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed function call template does not compromise the performance of function call execution while recucing escaping. The following example (Figure 4)illustrates the structure of our proposed function call template. Detailed code implementation can be found in our open-source repository.\n<|system|>\n# Tools\nYou may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.\nYou are provided with function signatures within <tools></tools> XML tags:<tools>\n{\"name\": \"get_weather\", \"description\": \"Get the weather of a city for a specific date.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"city\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The city to get weather for,in Chinese.\"}, \"date\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The date in YYYY-MM-DD format.\"}}, \"required\":\n</tools>\nFor each function call, output the function name and arguments within the following XML format:\n<tool_call>{function-name}\n<arg_key>{arg-key-1}</arg_key>\n<arg_value>{arg-value-1}</arg_v\n<arg_key>{arg-key-2}</arg_key>\n<arg_value>{arg-value-2}</arg_value>\n</tool_call><|system|>\nYou are a helpful assistant.<|user|>\nToday is June 26, 2024.

We experimented with removing the prompts in the bottom $50\\%$ based on response lengths, resulting in a $2\\%\\text{-}4\\%$  improvement in math and science tasks, despite training with only half the data. Notably, we found that applying response scaling to these hard prompts can lead to further gains. Generating four responses for each prompt brought an additional $\\mathrm{\\bar{1}\\char37}\\text{-}2\\char37$  improvement.\nAutomatic Agentic SFT Data ConstructionThe construction of agentic SFT data involves four steps: 1. Agentic Framework and Tool Collection: We gather a set of agentic frameworks and real-world tool APIs and MCP servers, while also leveraging LLMs to automatically construct and simulate a batch of tools. 2. Task Synthesis: Based on these frameworks and tools, we automatically synthesize a collection of agentic tasks. On the one hand, for relatively mature frameworks, we leverage LLMs to comprehend their functionalities and automatically generate relevant queries or tasks. On the other hand, for more fragmented or disparate tools, we frst select a representativei subset and similarly employ LLMs to construct tasks about this subset. These tasks encompass both single-step and multi-step tool calling scenarios. 3. Trajectory Generation: For each synthesized task,we utilize existing LLMs to generate tool-call trajectories. Additionally, by employing the LLM as a user simulator, multi-step tool-call tasks are converted into trajectories involving multiple rounds of dialogue. 4. Quality Filtering: For each trajectory, multiple judge agents are used to evaluate whether the task is completed. Only successful trajectories are retained.\n3.2Reasoning RL\nReasoning RL focuses on enhancing a model’s capabilities in domains that demand logical deduction,structured problem-solving, and verifable accuracy. This includes critical areas such as mathematics,i code generation, and scientifc reasoning. A defning characteristic of these tasks is the high precisionii of their reward signals, as correctness can often be determined programmatically or with objective clarity. Mastery in these areas is not only crucial for advancing the raw intelligence of models but also serves as a fundamental building block for more complex, multi-step agentic behaviors.Recognizing the unique challenges and opportunities within reasoning RL, we have developed a suite of specialized techniques to effectively train our models. These methods, detailed below, are designed to address issues such as training effciency, sample diversity, and data quality. Our overalli RL algorithm builds upon the GRPO [31] framework, excluding the KL loss term. The comparison curves shown in this section are based on our smaller experimental model, not on GLM-4.5.\nDiffculty-based Curriculum LearningDuring reinforcement learning, the model’s profciencyii evolves, creating a mismatch with static training data. In the later stages, as the model becomes more capable, overly simple data can lead to rollouts where all rewards are 1s. Conversely, in the early stages, excessively diffcult data often results in batches where all rewards are 0s. In bothi\n\nAIME24 AVG@32: RL with Difficulty-based Curriculum Learning\nFigure 5: Effectiveness of the two-stage diffculty-based curriculum on AIME’24. The blue linei(our method) switches to extremely diffcult problems (passi $@8{=}0,$  pass $\\rm\\rm\\char60512{>}0)$  in the second stage, showing continued improvement. The red line (baseline) continues with moderate-diffcultyi problems and plateaus.\nFigure 6: Single-stage vs. multi-stage RL at 64K context length. The red line (single-stage at 64K) achieves superior performance. The blue line (multi-stage with progressively increasing length)suffers from an irreversible performance drop in early stages, limiting its fnal performance.i\nscenarios, the lack of reward variance provides no useful gradient signal, severely hindering training effciency. To address this challenge, we employ a two-stage diffculty-based curriculum for RL. Theii effectiveness of this and other strategies discussed below is validated through controlled experiments on a smaller model, which allows for rapid iteration and precise ablation studies. As shown in Figure 5, this two-stage approach enables the model to consistently surpass its performance ceiling.Crucially, to maintain high signal quality and reduce noise, all problems used in the second stage are strictly sourced from a pool with verifed correct answers.i\nSingle-Stage RL at 64K Output LengthPrevious research [25] has suggested conducting RL in multiple stages with progressively increasing maximum output lengths. However, our experiments reveal that this multi-stage approach is less effective than a single-stage RL process conducted directly at the maximum target length of 64K. Since the initial Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) has already conditioned the model on generating 64K-length responses, introducing RL stages with shorter maximum lengths can cause the model to “unlearn” its long-context capabilities. This often leads to a signifcant and irreversible drop in performance, as the model’s average output length decreases.i This degradation is diffcult to recover from in the fnal 64K-length RL stage, thus limiting furtherii improvement. Our experiments confrm this observation: as demonstrated in Figure 6, applying RLi directly at the full 64K-length continually pushes the model’s limits and yields better performance.\n\nFigure 7: Ablation Studies for Code and Science RL. (Left) Comparison of loss calculation methods for code RL. The token-weighted mean loss approach achieves faster convergence compared to the sequence-mean loss baseline, accelerating the training process. (Right) Ablation on data sources for science RL on the GPQA-Diamond benchmark. Training exclusively on a small set of high-quality, expert-verifed multiple-choice questions yields the best performance, signifcantlyii outperforming training on mixed-quality data.\nDynamic Sampling TemperatureDuring RL, the sampling temperature is a key parameter for controlling trajectory diversity. A temperature that is too low leads to convergent, less exploratory outputs, while one that is too high introduces low-quality, noisy samples, undermining both model accuracy and training effciency. Using a fxed sampling temperature is suboptimal because it fails toii adapt as the policy distribution becomes more concentrated (i.e., has lower entropy), often resulting in insuffcient exploration at later stages. Therefore, we propose dynamically adjusting the samplingi temperature to maintain a healthy balance between accuracy and exploration. Specifcally, wheni the average reward of rollouts stabilizes, we identify this as a convergence phase and increase the sampling temperature to encourage greater diversity. To mitigate the risk of introducing excessive noise, we implement a quality-control mechanism: we periodically evaluate model performance on a held-out validation set across a range of temperatures. The temperature for the next training phase is then set to the maximum value that does not cause a performance drop of more than $1\\%$  from the current optimum [2].\nCode and Science RLCompared to mathematics, RL for coding and scientifc domains hasi received less attention in the literature. We conducted extensive controlled RL experiments in these areas and arrived at the following empirical conclusions. For code RL, we fnd that the choicei of loss calculation is critical for training effciency. As illustrated in Figure 7 (left), adopting ai token-weighted mean loss is highly benefcial compared to a conventional sequence-mean loss. Thei token-weighted approach provides a fner-grained and more stable gradient signal, which leads toi signifcantly faster convergence. This method also helps to alleviate the length bias inherent ini sequence-level rewards and effectively suppresses the generation of overly simplistic or repetitive“base case” samples during training. For science RL, our fndings on the GPQA-Diamond benchmarki highlight that data quality and type are paramount factors. As shown in Figure 7 (right), using exclusively expert-verifed multiple-choice questions for RL leads to signifcantly better performanceii compared to training with mixed-quality or unverifed data. This result underscores that even fori tasks with simple formats like multiple-choice, rigorously fltering the RL data pool to include onlyi high-quality, challenging instances is crucial for effective model improvement.\n3.3Agentic RL\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) helps language models follow human instructions more faithfully. Applying RL to math and programming contests has further uncovered strong reasoning abilities and favorable scaling behavior on tasks whose outcomes can be objectively verifed. Building on these insights, we focus on agentic settings—specifcally web-search andii code-generation agents—where every action or answer can be automatically checked. This built-in verifability supplies dense, reliable rewards, enabling us to scale RL training more effectively.i\n\n3.3.1Data Collection and Synthesis for Agents\nFor web-search tasks and open-domain information seeking, we develop a data-synthesis pipeline that yields demanding question–answer pairs requiring multi-step reasoning across multiple web sources. This corpus is designed to sharpen GLM’s ability to uncover elusive, interwoven facts on the internet. Dataset construction blends two approaches: (1) an automated pipeline powered by multi-hop reasoning over knowledge graphs, and (2) human-in-the-loop extraction and selective obfuscation of content from several web pages to prepare reinforcement-learning training signals.\nFor software-engineering tasks, we curate an extensive collection of GitHub pull requests and issues to create a realistic software-development benchmark comprising user prompts and executable unit tests. All evaluations run inside a hardened sandbox with a distributed system, which provides both horizontal scalability and strong isolation guarantees.\n3.3.2Pushing the Limits with Reinforcement Learning and Iterative Self-distillation\nWe adopt the group-wise policy optimization algorithm for RL training. For each problem x, we sample $K$ agent traces $\\{y_{1},\\ldots,y_{k}\\}$  from the previous policy $\\pi_{\\mathrm{old}},$  and optimize the model $\\pi_{\\theta}$  with respect to the following objective:\n$$L_{\\texttt{RL}}(\\theta)=\\mathbb{E}_{x\\sim\\mathcal{D}} \\left[\\frac{1}{K}\\sum_{i=1}^{K}\\left(r(x,y_{i})-\\bar{r}(x)\\right)\\right],$$\nwhere $\\begin{array}{c}\\bar{r}(x)=\\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{i=1}^{k}r\\big(x,y_{i} \\big)\\end{array}$ is the mean reward of the sampled responses. It is noted that only model-generated tokens are used for optimization, and the environment feedback is ignored in loss computation.\nOutcome Supervision with Process Action Format PenaltyFor web search tasks, we use the accuracy of the fnal answer as a reward for the entire agent trace. For coding agents, we primarilyi utilize SWE data with verifable test cases for RL training. Our experiments have shown that RLi training on web search and SWE tasks leads to generalized performance improvements across other tasks and benchmarks, such as general tool usage and coding tasks like Terminal-Bench. Additionally,we apply a process format penalty to ensure the model generates correct tool call formats. If the model fails to produce the correct tool format during agent trace generation, the process will be halted, and the trace will receive a zero reward.\nIterative DistillationSince RL training on agent tasks is time-consuming, we adopt a selfdistillation approach to iteratively enhance the performance of the SFT cold-start model before resuming RL training on this improved model. Specifcally, we frst perform RL training on theii initial cold-start model to boost agent performance. Once training has reached a certain step count or plateaued, we apply self-distillation by substituting the original cold-start data with responses generated by the RL-trained model, thus creating a superior SFT model. We then conduct further RL training on this enhanced model, progressively increasing training diffculty. This iterative strategyi allows us to push the performance limits of RL-trained models effciently.i\nScaling Test-time Compute via Interaction TurnsFor agent tasks, we observe signifcant perfor-i mance gains given increasing interaction turns with the environment. Compared to test-time scaling in reasoning models, which scales output tokens, agent tasks make use of test-time compute by continuously interacting with the environment, e.g., searching high and low for hard-to-fnd webi information or writing test cases for self-verifcation and self-correction for coding tasks. Figure 8i shows that with varying browsing effort, accuracy scales smoothly with test-time compute.\n3.4General RL\nGeneral RL aims to holistically improve the model’s overall performance, remediate potential issues,and strengthen key capabilities. Central to our methodology is a multi-source feedback system that synergizes rule-based feedback, human feedback (RLHF), and model-based feedback (RLAIF).This hybrid framework provides more robust training signals and allows us to leverage the unique advantages of each source: the precision of automated rules, the nuanced judgment of human annotators, and the scalability of AI-driven evaluation.\n\nFigure 8: Interaction Turns Scaling for BrowseComp.\nReward & SysBench Score During Instruction Following RL\nFigure 9: Training curve of Instruction Following RL without other General RL tasks. During GRPO training, the instruction following performance (SysBench-ISR) improves in step with the increasing reward. Up to roughly 1,000 training steps, we have not observed clear evidence of reward hacking.\nHolistic RLHolistic RL targets broad performance gains across diverse domains. To this end, we frst construct a balanced dataset of roughly 5,000 prompts spanning 7 primary, 33 secondary, andi 139 tertiary categories. Reward signals for Holistic RL are derived from both human and AI feedback.For human feedback, we train a reward model on preference annotations. Annotators compare model responses and assign preference labels based on a comprehensive evaluation of multiple dimensions,such as instruction following, safety, and factual correctness. For model feedback, we design separate scoring rubrics that depend on whether the prompt has an objective ground-truth answer. Merging the two feedback sources yields more reliable and expressive reward signals, mitigating the inherent limitations of each individual method.\nInstruction Following RLInstruction Following RL improves the model’s ability to understand and satisfy complex instructions. To achieve this, we create a fne-grained taxonomy with 7 major andi 151 minor constraint types, covering content requirements, formatting rules, and more. Based on this taxonomy, a dedicated training set of challenging instructions is assembled to cover every constraint type. The feedback system consists of deterministic verifcation rules, a trained reward model, and ai critique model. The robustness of this hybrid feedback system proves crucial during GRPO training.We observe mitigated reward hacking, enabling the policy model to achieve continuous and steady improvements in instruction following as shown in Figure 9.\nFunction Calling RLFunction Calling RL is divided into step-wise rule-based RL and end-to-end multi-turn RL. We incorporate step-wise rule-based RL directly into our general RL framework dueto their similar output lengths and convergence speeds. For end-to-end multi-turn RL, we frst traini specialized expert models and then distill these experts into the main model.\nStep-wise Rule-based RL: For tasks with clear tool invocation procedures, we annotate the ground truth function call for each step/turn in the training data. Given the task and the function calls from previous steps/turns, the model is trained to generate the next assistant response, which can be a function call or a response to the user. Using rule-based rewards, we guide the model to make correct function calls over consecutive rounds. Accordingly, we design the following strict reward function:\n$$\\mathrm{Reward}=\\left\\{\\begin{aligned} & 1,&&\\mathrm{if} \\mathtt{FormalCorrect}(a_{t}) \\mathrm{and} \\mathtt{Match}(a_{t},a_{t}^{*})\\\\ & 0,&&\\mathrm{otherwise}\\end{aligned}\\right.$$\nHere, $a_{t}$ denotes the t-th function call generated by the model, and $a_{t}^{*}$ is the corresponding ground truth function call. A reward of 1 is only given if $a_{t}$  is in the correct format and matches the ground truth exactly (including the name, parameters, and every feld). Otherwise, the reward isi 0. Such a strict reward rule not only guides the model to generate correct function calls but also strongly enforces output formatting, improving the model’s usability and robustness in real-world interactions.\nEnd-to-end Multi-turn RL: Step-wise rule-based RL decomposes tasks into static, predetermined decision fows. In this process, the model lacks dynamic interactions with the environment andl cannot autonomously explore, plan, or handle complex situations, thereby making its real-world problem-solving ability limited. To address these issues, we introduce end-to-end multi-turn function calling RL, where the model frst generates the complete trajectory and is then rewardedi based on task completion. In this way, the model can optimize its action policy through continuous trial and error with tool feedback, signifcantly enhancing its ability in autonomous planning andi decision-making. Specifcally, end-to-end multi-turn function calling RL considers two types ofi complex tasks: 1. single-turn multi-step tasks: The model needs to make multi-step function calls and interact with the environment to complete such tasks. We use complex tasks automatically synthesized based on MCP servers, as well as some open-source agentic datasets with runnable environments, such as Agentgym [46]. 2. multi-turn multi-step tasks: Besides interacting with the tool execution environment, the model also needs to interact with an LLM-simulated user agent to obtain complete task information and accomplish the overall task. The reward for end-to-end multi-turn function calling RL is computed as:\nHere, $I$ refers to the original complex task, $a_{t}$ is the t-th function call, and $o_{t}$  is the tool feedback or user information. TaskComplet $\\mathtt{ed}(I,o_{0},a_{1},o_{1},\\ldots,a_{T},o_{T})$  indicates whether the task is completed, which is determined by the environment according to predefned rules or by an LLMi Judge Agent.\nPathology RLAs the fnal stage of post-training, general RL needs to rectify potential issues,i such as language mixing, excessive repetition, and formatting mistakes. Although penalizing such behaviors in the above-mentioned general RL tasks is effective, the low incidence rate of these pathologies (often less than $1\\%$  of outputs) makes this a sample-ineffcient optimization strategy.i Therefore, we curate a targeted dataset for pathology RL by identifying prompts that are highly likely to trigger these pathological behaviors. Training on this dataset lets us impose effcient penalties,i further lowering the residual error rates for these problematic behaviors.\n3.5RL Infrastructure\nOur RL infrastructure is built upon Slime1, an open-source framework we developed. The framework is engineered with several key optimizations to enhance fexibility, effciency, and extensibility.li\nFlexible Hybrid Training and Data Generation ArchitectureA core feature of our infrastructure is its support for highly fexible training paradigms and data generation strategies within a single,l unifed system. This design allows us to cater to the distinct requirements of various RL tasks byi\n\nFigure 10: Overview of the Slime RL infrastructure. The system consists of three core modules:Training (Megatron) – handles the main training process, reads data from the Data Buffer, and synchronizes parameters with the rollout module after training; Rollout (SGLang + Router) –generates new data, including rewards and verifer outputs, and writes it to the Data Buffer; Datai Buffer – serves as a bridge module that manages prompt initialization, custom data, and rollout generation strategies.\nsupporting both a colocated, synchronous mode and a disaggregated, asynchronous mode. This fexibility in data generation is crucial for extending our RL capabilities to new domains and morel complex agentic environments. We observed that different RL tasks beneft from different schedulingi approaches. For general-purpose RL tasks or those aimed at enhancing model reasoning capabilities(e.g., in mathematics and code generation), a synchronous, colocated architecture is more effective. In this setup, the training and inference engines reside on the same worker. This, combined with dynamic sampling, signifcantly reduces GPU idle time and maximizes resource utilization. Conversely, fori agentic tasks, such as those in Software Engineering (SWE), the data generation process is often protracted and involves complex system interactions. To ensure that the agent environments can operate continuously and maximize data throughput, we adopt a disaggregated, asynchronous model.The rollout component of the RL framework is exposed directly to the agent environment, while the GPUs for training and inference are scheduled independently. This decoupling enables the agent environments to constantly generate new data without being stalled by the training cycle. By leveraging the resource scheduling and asynchronous capabilities of the Ray framework, we can fexibly place the inference and training engines on the same GPU or on different ones. This duall support for synchronous and asynchronous training allows diverse RL tasks to share a common set of underlying optimizations for both training and inference.\nAccelerated Rollout with Mixed-Precision InferenceRollout effciency is a persistent bottlenecki in RL training. To address this, our infrastructure supports BF16 for training while leveraging FP8 for inference to accelerate the data generation phase. During each policy update iteration, we perform online, block-wise FP8 quantization on the model parameters before they are dispatched for rollout.This dynamic quantization enables highly effcient FP8 inference, signifcantly improving the overallii throughput of the data collection process.\nAgent-oriented RL Infra DesignTo conduct RL for agent tasks, we design a fully asynchronous and decoupled RL infrastructure that effciently handles long-horizon agent rollouts and supportsi fexible multi-task RL training across diverse agent frameworks.l\nAgentic rollouts often require prolonged interactions with complex environments, which can signif-i cantly slow down the overall RL training process. To overcome this, we frst design a high-concurrencyi Docker-based runtime that provisions isolated environments for each task, drastically reducing rollout overhead. In addition, we implement a fully asynchronous RL training loop. Because agent tasks can vary in type and trajectory length, synchronous RL training often leads to severe GPU underutilization as workers wait for the slowest rollouts to complete. Our approach partitions GPUs into dedicated rollout engines and training engines: the rollout engines continuously generate trajectories, while the training engines update the model weights and periodically synchronize them back to the rollout engines. This decoupled design prevents long or diverse trajectories from blocking the entire trainingpipeline, resulting in consistently high throughput, particularly in scenarios with highly variable agent interactions.\nAnother key challenge is the diversity of existing agent frameworks, which are tailored to different tasks. Leveraging these frameworks not only improves task-specifc performance but also maintainsi alignment between training and inference. To achieve this, we introduce a unifed HTTP endpointi interface coupled with a centralized data pool. Since most agent frameworks produce rollouts in a message-list format, all trajectories are stored in this data pool, which serves as a shared source for training. This architecture cleanly decouples task-specifc rollout logic from the RL training process,i enabling seamless integration of heterogeneous agent frameworks. Furthermore, the data pool supports customizable, task-specifc fltering and dynamic sampling strategies to ensure high-qualityii RL training data across diverse tasks.\nThrough these two core designs, our system provides a scalable, fexible, and high-performancel solution for long-agentic RL, and can support long-horizon rollouts and adapt to a wide range of agent tasks.\n4Evaluation\n4.1Evaluation of Base Models\nWe frst evaluate the performance of our base model GLM-4.5-Base. Table 2 shows the comparisoni results of the last checkpoint of pre-training of our base model. Please note that the base model has not been trained on instruction data, and the GLM-4.5-Base scores are from our internal evaluation framework. Results show that GLM-4.5-Base is stable on all the different benchmarks, including English, Code, Math, and Chinese, which validates our idea of unifying all the abilities into one model.\nTable 2: Comparison among GLM-4.5-Base and other representative open-source base models.\n\n\n<html><body><table><thead><tr><td></td><td>Benchmark (Metric)</td><td>Qwen3-235B -A22B Base</td><td>Llama4-Maverick 400B Base</td><td>DeepSeek-V3 Base</td><td>Kimi-K2 Base</td><td>GLM-4.5 Base</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan=\"3\"></td><td>Architecture</td><td>MoE</td><td>MoE</td><td>MoE</td><td>MoE</td><td>MoE</td></tr><tr><td># Activated Params</td><td>22B</td><td>17B</td><td>37B</td><td>32B</td><td>32B</td></tr><tr><td># Total Params</td><td>235B</td><td>400B</td><td>671B</td><td>1043B</td><td>355B</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"6\">English</td><td>SimpleQA (EM)</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>26.6</td><td>35.3</td><td>30.0</td></tr><tr><td>BBH (EM)</td><td>88.9</td><td>87.1</td><td>88.4</td><td>88.7</td><td>86.2</td></tr><tr><td>MMLU (EM)</td><td>87.8</td><td>85.2</td><td>87.2</td><td>87.8</td><td>86.1</td></tr><tr><td>HellaSwag (EM)</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>88.9</td><td>94.6</td><td>87.1</td></tr><tr><td>PIQA (EM)</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>84.7</td><td>-</td><td>85.3</td></tr><tr><td>TriviaQA (EM)</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>82.9</td><td>85.1</td><td>80.0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Code</td><td>EvalPlus (Pass@1)</td><td>77.6</td><td>65.5</td><td>65.6</td><td>80.3</td><td>78.1</td></tr><tr><td>LiveCodeBench-Base (Pass@1)</td><td>-</td><td>25.1</td><td>24.6</td><td>26.3</td><td>28.1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Math</td><td>GSM8K (EM) MATH (EM)</td><td>94.4 71.8</td><td>87.7 63.3</td><td>87.6</td><td>92.1</td><td>79.4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>62.6</td><td>70.2</td><td>61.0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"4\">Chinese</td><td>CLUEWSC (EM)</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>82.7</td><td>-</td><td>83.5</td></tr><tr><td>C-Eval (EM)</td><td>-</td><td>80.9</td><td>90.1</td><td>92.5</td><td>86.9</td></tr><tr><td>C3 (EM)</td><td>-</td><td></td><td>78.6</td><td>-</td><td>83.1</td></tr><tr><td>Chinese-SimpleQA (EM)</td><td>-</td><td>53.5</td><td>72.1</td><td>77.6</td><td>70.1</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>\n\n4.2Evaluation on 12 (ARC) Benchmarks\nWe further evaluate our full GLM-4.5 models after Post-Training for all the Agentic, Reasoning, and Coding (ARC) tasks, on 12 benchmarks: MMLU-Pro, AIME 24, MATH-500, SciCode, GPQA, HLE,LCB (2407-2501), SWE-Bench Verifed, Terminal-Bench, TAU-Bench, BFCL V3, BrowseComp.i\n4.2.1Evaluation of Agentic Abilities\nWe evaluate the agentic abilities of GLM-4.5 in two aspects: TAU-bench [48] (including retail and airline domains) and Berkeley Function Call Leaderboard V3 (BFCL V3) [26], which measures the model’s ability to call user-defned functions to respond to users’ queries.

For the AIME and GPQA benchmarks, we report the average accuracy over 32 and 8 samples, respectively (Avg@32, Avg@8), to mitigate result variance.An LLM was used for automated answer validation. For the HLE benchmark, only the text-based questions were evaluated, with correctness judged by GPT-4o. Our evaluation code is also opensourced3. We also compute the average reasoning performance on the seven benchmarks with the intelligence index proposed by Artifcial Analysis4. GLM-4.5 outperforms OpenAI o3 on AIME 24i and SciCode. On average, GLM-4.5 outperforms Claude Opus 4 and is close to DeepSeek-R1-0528.\nTable 4: Results on Reasoning Benchmarks.

MultiChallenge is a multi-turn conversational benchmark evaluating LLMs across four integrated capability dimensions. SysBench systematically evaluates LLMs’ system message following capabilities across multi-turn conversations through three-level granularity metrics.On the MMLU benchmark, nearly all fagship models, including GLM-4.5, demonstrate performancel at a comparable level. SimpleQA, which refects the factual knowledge of a model, shows thatl GLM-4.5 (355B) performs similarly to DeepSeek V3 and R1 (both 671B), despite having nearly half of the parameters. On the IFEval benchmark, GLM-4.5 outperforms DeepSeek R1. In the Sysbench evaluation, GLM-4.5 surpasses GPT-4.1, DeepSeek V3, and Kimi K2. Additionally, on the MultiChallenge benchmark, it demonstrates superior performance compared to both GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek R1.\n4.2.5Evaluation of Safety\nTo systematically assess the safety alignment of our model, we utilized SafetyBench [51], a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety of large language models. SafetyBench consists of 11,435 multiple-choice questions covering seven distinct categories of safety concerns, with data in both English and Chinese. This benchmark enables a standardized and scalable evaluation of a model’s ability to handle potentially harmful or sensitive topics. The categories include Ethics and Morality, Illegal Activities, Mental Health, Offensiveness, Physical Health, Privacy and Property, and Unfairness and Bias. We evaluated GLM-4.5 against a suite of other leading models. The results indicate that GLM-4.5 achieves a strong safety score, competitive with other top-tier models. Its overall score of 89.87 is comparable to that of Kimi-K2 (90.48) and GPT-4.1 (89.71). Notably,GLM-4.5 demonstrates robust performance in the areas of Ethics and Morality (94.33), Mental Health(94.67), and Physical Health (96.67). While it performs well in preventing responses related to Illegal Activities (90.97) and protecting Privacy and Property (92.00), there is still room for improvement in addressing Unfairness and Bias, an area of ongoing focus for our development efforts. The detailed performance breakdown is presented in the table below.\n4.3Evaluations for Hands-on Experience\nSometimes, a trained LLM may overft some predefned benchmarks, which makes the evaluatedii results not precisely refect real-world experience. To overcome this challenge and to gauge ourl model’s performance in more realistic situations, we have established a comprehensive manual evaluation framework. Human evaluation is particularly advantageous for assessing performance on open-ended questions, where aspects like coherence, relevance, and creativity are paramount.This hands-on approach allows for a more granular analysis, enabling us to better pinpoint areas of weakness and understand the qualitative aspects of model behavior that automated metrics often miss.\n\nTable 7: Evaluation Results on SafetyBench\n\n\n<html><body><table><thead><tr><td>Model</td><td>Average </td><td>Ethics & Morality</td><td>Illegal Activities</td><td>Mental Health</td><td> Offensiveness </td><td>Health</td><td>PhysicalPrivacy & Property</td><td>Unfairness & Bias</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>GLM-4.5</td><td>89.9</td><td>94.3</td><td>91.0</td><td>94.7</td><td>83.0</td><td>96.7</td><td>92.0</td><td>77.4</td></tr><tr><td>GLM-4.5-Air</td><td>87.8</td><td>91.0</td><td>90.3</td><td>92.7</td><td>83.3</td><td>92.3</td><td>90.3</td><td>74.7</td></tr><tr><td>Gemini 2.5 Pro</td><td>90.5</td><td>94.7</td><td>91.7</td><td>95.3</td><td>84.3</td><td>97.0</td><td>92.3</td><td>78.0</td></tr><tr><td>Kimi K2</td><td>90.5</td><td>93.0</td><td>93.3</td><td>95.0</td><td>90.3</td><td>97.3</td><td>93.0</td><td>71.3</td></tr><tr><td>GPT-4.1</td><td>89.7</td><td>92.0</td><td>94.3</td><td>95.3</td><td>85.3</td><td>95.7</td><td>91.3</td><td>74.0</td></tr><tr><td>DeepSeek-V3-0324</td><td>88.8</td><td>92.3</td><td>90.7</td><td>95.0</td><td>84.7</td><td>95.7</td><td>91.0</td><td>72.3</td></tr><tr><td>DeepSeek-R1-0528</td><td>83.5</td><td>87.0</td><td>81.7</td><td>86.7</td><td>77.7</td><td>92.0</td><td>85.7</td><td>73.7</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>\n\n4.3.1Evaluation of General Chat\nTo test the practical application capabilities of our models, we curated a diverse dataset of realscenario user prompts. These prompts span multiple languages and cover a wide range of categories,including Mathematics, Text Processing, Text Generation, Subjective QA, Objective QA, Logical Reasoning, and Code Instructions. We meticulously fltered this collection to ensure high quality andi appropriate diffculty, while also removing any data that could compromise user privacy or safety.i The fnal dataset consists of 660 prompts, with a distribution of 392 in English, 108 in Chinese, andi 160 in other languages. For prompts requiring factual knowledge, we annotated the correct answers to serve as a ground truth for evaluation.\nWe conducted a comparative evaluation between GLM-4.5, Deepseek-R1-0528, and Kimi K2. For each prompt, the responses from the different models were presented in a randomized order to eliminate any potential sequential bias. A single, consistent evaluator then scored each response on a scale of 0 to 10. This method of using the same evaluator at the same time for a batch of comparisons is designed to minimize deviations arising from different individual preferences and subjective standards. The reasoning contents of GLM-4.5 and Deepseek-R1-0528 are not presented to the evaluators. The average scores for each model across the different categories and languages are presented below.\nEnglish ResultsIn the English prompt set, GLM-4.5 achieved the highest overall score.

We compare GLM-4.5 against three strong baselines: Claude Sonnet 4, Kimi K2, and Qwen3-Coder. Each task was executed in an isolated containerized environment to prevent cross-task interference, with models initialized using predefned API confgurations. Testing was conducted interactively by human experts overii multiple rounds: each task began with a standardized prompt, followed by iterative interactions whereexperts adjusted inputs based on model outputs until the task was completed or failed. To ensure fairness, the same expert followed consistent interaction strategies across all models.\nBased on this testing procedure, model performance was evaluated using the following criteria:the primary metric was task completion, determined by predefned completion criteria. In casesi of ties, effciency and reliability—including tool calling success rate and token consumption eff-ii ciency—were used as secondary metrics. The evaluation prioritized functional correctness and task completion over effciency metrics, ensuring that coding capability remained the primary evaluationi focus.\nResultsIn head-to-head evaluations, GLM-4.5 demonstrated strong performance relative to opensource baselines and competitive capability against closed-source models as shown in fgure 12.i Specifcally:i\nGLM-4.5 vs Claude Sonnet 4: $40.4\\%$ win, $9.6\\%$ tie, $50.0\\%$ loss\nGLM-4.5 vs Kimi K2: $53.9\\%$ win, $17.3\\%$ tie, $28.8\\%$ loss\nGLM-4.5 vs Qwen3-Coder: $80.8\\%$ win, $7.7\\%$ tie, $11.5\\%$ loss\nAs shown in fgure 13, GLM-4.5 particularly excelled in tool calling reliability, achieving the highesti success rate at $\\mathbf{90.6\\%},$  compared to Claude Sonnet 4 $(89.5\\%),$  Kimi-K2 $(86.2\\%)$  and Qwen3-Coder(77.1%). While Claude Sonnet 4 remains a strong competitor, GLM-4.5 outperformed other models in both task completion consistency and agentic execution robustness.\n4.3.3Evaluation of Logical Reasoning\nTo rigorously assess the true logical reasoning capabilities of the models and mitigate the risk of data contamination from common logical questions found online, we constructed a new, challenging evaluation set. This set comprises novel and complex logical reasoning problems that are structurally different from those widely available on the internet. Each problem is designed to require multiple steps of logical deduction to arrive at the correct solution.\nFor this evaluation, we established a unifed and detailed scoring standard for each question. Wei then tasked each model with solving these problems. The correctness and quality of each model’s response were subsequently inspected and scored by human experts. The results show a competitive landscape, with GLM-4.5 performing on par with leading models.\nTable 11: Expert Evaluation Scores on Novel Logical Reasoning Problems\n\n\n<html><body><table><thead><tr><td>Model</td><td>Score</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gemini 2.5 Pro</td><td>65.8</td></tr><tr><td>DeepSeek-R1-0528</td><td>62.1</td></tr><tr><td>GLM-4.5</td><td>62.0</td></tr><tr><td>GLM-4.5-Air</td><td>53.4</td></tr><tr><td>Kimi K2</td><td>51.9</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>\n\n4.4Evaluation of Translation\nThe New Paradigm of TranslationTranslation today extends beyond simple text conversion to encompass a nuanced understanding of evolving internet slang, cultural context, and domain-specifci terminology:\nNetizen Lingo: Translating “yyds” accurately requires recognizing it as the acronym for the Chinese phrase “永远的神” (yoˇng yuaˇn de shén), meaning “the eternal god,” thus capturing its true sentiment of enthusiastic praise and admiration.\nDomain Nicknames: Recognizing “胖” (literally “fat white”) is critical within photography communities. Specialized models may translate it incorrectly, but a general-purpose model understands it as a widely used nickname for the “Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM” lens, providing precise translations.\n\nSymbols: When a Chinese user sends a “fsh” emoji in a conversation to refer to a second-handi marketplace, can the model understand the cultural meme behind it, which points to the “闲鱼”(Xiányú) platform? This tests the model’s cognitive ability to connect visual symbols with online cultural phenomena.\nDeep Contextual Reasoning: Translating “三花公主驾到,速来围观” demands identifying “三花”not as a person’s name but as a reference to the popular calico coloration of cats. A general-purpose model accurately deduces this context, translating the phrase idiomatically as “The Calico Princess has arrived! Come and see!”.\nThese examples underscore modern translation as a task rooted deeply in knowledge and reasoning.\nEvaluation ResultsWe tested 100 challenging, real-world cases commonly mistranslated by current tools, comparing GLM-4.5 against specialized translation models (Qwen-MT-plus, QwenMT-turbo, Seed-X [9]) in a blind human evaluation (scored 0-3 considering whether the meaning is conveyed correctly and whether the language is authentic). The results are shown in Table 12.\nTable 12: Human Scores on Selected Challenging Translation data\n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Model</td><td>Average Score</td></tr><tr><td>GLM-4.5</td><td>1.71</td></tr><tr><td>Qwen-MT-plus</td><td>0.38</td></tr><tr><td>Qwen-MT-turbo</td><td>0.55</td></tr><tr><td>Seed-X</td><td>0.65</td></tr></table></body></html>\n\nGLM-4.5 signifcantly outperforms specialized models. For example, translating “三花公主驾到”i specialized models failed contextually, whereas GLM-4.5 accurately conveys the idiomatic meaning.\n5Conclusion\nIn this report, we have introduced the GLM-4.5 model series, including GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.5-Air.Both models adopt the MoE architecture, which improves the computational effciency compared toi previous GLM models. GLM-4.5 excels at reasoning, coding, and agentic tasks, ranked in 3rd place globally among open-source and proprietary models. We release the model weights of GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.5-Air to advance the applications and research of large language models.\n\n6Contribution\nContributors’ names are listed in alphabetical order by frst name.
