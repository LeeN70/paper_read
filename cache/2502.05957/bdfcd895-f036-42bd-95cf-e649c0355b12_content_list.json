This stark accessibility gap raises a fundamental question: Can we enable everyone,regardless of technical background, to build their own LLM agents using natural language alone? To address this challenge, we introduce AutoAgent - a Fully-Automated and highly Self-Developing framework that enables users to create and deploy LLM agents through Natural Language Alone. Operating as an autonomous Agent Operating System, AutoAgent comprises four key components: i) Agentic System Utilities, ii) LLM-powered Actionable Engine, ii) Self-Managing File System,and iv) SelfPlay Agent Customization module. This lightweight yet powerful system enables efficient and dynamic creation and modification of tools,agents,and workflows without coding requirements or manual intervention. Beyond its code-free agent development capabilities, AutoAgent also serves as a versatile multi-agent system for General AI Assistants. Comprehensive evaluations on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate AutoAgent's efectiveness in generalist multi-agent tasks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore,AutoAgent's Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-related capabilities have shown consistently superior performance compared to many alternative LLM-based solutions. ",

At each time step, the LLM agent observes the current state,selects an action based on its policy, interacts with the environment,and updates its state, often referred to as the agent's “context’. The mapping from state to action can follow two primary paradigms: Tool-Use[7], where the agent utilizes external capabilities,and ReAct [8] (Non-tool-use), where the agent generates the next action solely based on its internal language model.

A common design is the Orchestrator-Workers paradigm [9,10], where the Orchestrator comprehends the task and distributes subtasks to Workers via transfer actions.

The comprehensive agent trajectory for this intricate and complex requirement is presented in illuminating detail in Tab 6 within the Appendix. This detailed account reveals that while the Orchestrator encountered a SyntaxError during the initial creation phase, the resilient and adaptable Agent Editor component was able to adeptly self-debug and successfully complete the task, thereby strikingly demonstrating the robustness of AutoAgentsystem.

To validate the workflow's practicality, we performed comparative experiments on the MATH-500 dataset [42] using 3 LLMs (gpt-4o-20240806,claude-3.5-sonnet-20241022, deepseek-v3) and a Majority Voting workflow.
