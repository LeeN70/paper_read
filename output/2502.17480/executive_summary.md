## Brain-to-Text Decoding: A Safer Path to Restoring Communication

### The Problem

Millions of people worldwide lose their ability to speak or communicate due to brain injuries, strokes, or diseases like ALS. Current brain-computer interfaces that can restore communication require invasive brain surgery, carrying significant risks including brain hemorrhage and infection. These surgical implants are also difficult to maintain long-term and aren't scalable to help the large number of patients who need them.

### The Breakthrough

Researchers have developed **Brain2Qwerty**, a non-invasive brain-computer interface that can decode typed sentences from brain activity measured outside the skull. Using advanced AI and magnetoencephalography (MEG) technology, this approach achieves character-error-rates as low as **19%** for the best participants—dramatically narrowing the performance gap with invasive methods while eliminating surgical risks.

### How It Works

Participants type memorized sentences on a keyboard while their brain activity is recorded using MEG sensors. The Brain2Qwerty AI system processes these brain signals through three stages: (1) a convolutional module that extracts patterns from 500ms windows of brain activity, (2) a transformer module that understands sentence-level context, and (3) a language model that corrects output using natural language patterns. The system achieves **32% average accuracy** across all participants and can perfectly decode many sentences it wasn't trained on.

### Why This Matters

This breakthrough opens the door to safe, accessible communication restoration for patients who cannot speak or move. Unlike invasive methods requiring brain surgery, this approach could help millions of people with conditions like stroke, traumatic brain injury, or neurodegenerative diseases regain the ability to communicate without surgical risks. The technology also demonstrates that non-invasive methods can approach the performance of invasive implants.

### The Business Opportunity

This non-invasive approach creates new possibilities for scalable brain-computer interface products that could serve the massive market of patients with communication disorders, potentially revolutionizing assistive technology and neurorehabilitation while eliminating the regulatory and safety barriers of invasive implants.
