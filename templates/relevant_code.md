## Architecture Overview

[Provide a high-level overview of the codebase structure. Describe the main directories, modules, and how they relate to each other. If pseudocode: describe the conceptual architecture based on the paper. 2-4 paragraphs.]

### Directory Structure

[If repository found, show key directories and their purposes:
```
repo/
├── src/          - Description
├── models/       - Description
├── data/         - Description
└── experiments/  - Description
```

If pseudocode: show conceptual organization of components.]

## Key Implementation

[Provide detailed explanations of the core algorithms and techniques from the paper, with actual code snippets or pseudocode. Include 3-5 major implementation sections:]

### [Core Algorithm/Method 1]

[Explanation of what this implements from the paper. Reference specific sections/equations if relevant.]

```python
# Code snippet or pseudocode
[Show key implementation details]
```

**Key aspects**:
- [Technical detail 1]
- [Technical detail 2]
- [Technical detail 3]

### [Core Algorithm/Method 2]

[Explanation of the implementation]

```python
# Code snippet or pseudocode
[Show implementation]
```

**Key aspects**:
- [Technical detail 1]
- [Technical detail 2]

[Continue for 3-5 major implementation sections]

## Relation to Paper

[Map the code implementation back to specific sections of the paper. This is crucial for understanding how the paper's ideas are realized in code:]

| Paper Section | Code Component | Notes |
|--------------|----------------|-------|
| Section X: [Method Name] | `module/file.py:ClassName` | [Implementation notes] |
| Algorithm 1 | `core/algorithm.py:function_name` | [How it's implemented] |
| Equation Y | `models/model.py:forward()` | [Mathematical correspondence] |
| Figure Z | `visualization/plot.py` | [Visualization code] |

### Key Differences from Paper

[If applicable, note any important differences between the paper description and actual implementation:]
- [Difference 1 - explain why]
- [Difference 2 - explain why]
- [Difference 3 - explain why]
