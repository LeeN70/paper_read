It has been shown to enhance accuracy on reasoning tasks, align with social values, and adapt to user preferences, all while requiring relatively minimal computational resources against pre-training. In the context of reasoning capabilities, OpenAI's o1 (OpenAI, 2024b) series models were the first to introduce inference-time scaling by increasing the length of the Chain-ofThought reasoning process. This approach has achieved significant improvements in various reasoning tasks, such as mathematics, coding, and scientific reasoning. However, the challenge of effective test-time scaling remains an open question for the research community. Several prior works have explored various approaches, including process-based reward models (Lightman et al.,2023; Uesato et al.,2022; Wang et al.,2023),reinforcement learning (Kumar et al.,2024), and search algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search and Beam Search (Feng et al.,2024; Trinh et al., 2024; Xin et al., 2024).

Upon nearing convergence in the RL process, we create new SFT data through rejection sampling on the RL checkpoint, combined with supervised data from DeepSeek-V3 in domains such as writing, factual QA,and self-cognition,and then retrain the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. After fine-tuning with the new data,the checkpoint undergoes an additional RL proces, taking into account prompts from all scenarios.

During the training process, we observe that CoT often exhibits language mixing, particularly when RL prompts involve multiple languages. To mitigate the issue of language mixing, we introduce a language consistency reward during RL training, which is calculated as the proportion of target language words in the CoT. Although ablation experiments show that such alignment results in a slight degradation in the model's performance, this reward aligns with human preferences, making it more readable.

However, in practice,PRM has three main limitations that may hinder its ultimate success. First, it is challenging to explicitly define a fine-grain step in general reasoning. Second, determining whether the current intermediate step is correct is a challenging task. Automated annotation using models may not yield satisfactory results, while manual annotation is not conducive to scaling up. Third,once a model-based PRM is introduced, it inevitably leads to reward hacking (Gao et al.,2022),and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources and it complicates the whole training pipeline. In conclusion, while PRM demonstrates a good ability to rerank the top-N responses generated by the model or assist in guided search (Snell et al., 2024),its advantages are limited compared to the additional computational overhead it introduces during the large-scale reinforcement learning process in our experiments.

This approach involves breaking answers into smaller parts to allow the model to explore the solution space systematically. To facilitate this, we prompt the model to generate multiple tags that correspond to specific reasoning steps necessary for the search. For training, we first use colected prompts to find answers via MCTS guided by a pre-trained value model.

Second, the value model directly influences the quality of generation since it guides each step of the search process. Training a fine-grained value model is inherently difficult, which makes it challenging for the model to iteratively improve.
