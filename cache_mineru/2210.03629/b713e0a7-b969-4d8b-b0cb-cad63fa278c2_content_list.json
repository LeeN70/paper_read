In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner, allowing for greater synergy between the two: reasoning traces help the model induce, track,and update action plans as well as handle exceptions,while actions allow it to interface with and gather additional information from external sources such as knowledge bases or environments. We apply our approach, named ReAct, to a diverse set of language and decision making tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art baselines in addition to improved human interpretability and trustworthiness. Concretely, on question answering (HotpotQA) and fact verification (Fever), ReAct overcomes prevalent issues of hallucination and error propagation in chain-of-thought reasoning by interacting with a simple Wikipedia API, and generating human-like task-solving trajectories that are more interpretable than baselines without reasoning traces. Furthermore,on two interactive decision making benchmarks (ALFWorld and WebShop),ReAct outperforms imitation and reinforcement learning methods by an absolute success rate of 34% and 1O% respectively, while being prompted with only one or two in-context examples.

Consider the example of cooking up a dish in the kitchen. Between any two specific actions, we may reason in language in order to track progress(\"now that everything is cut,I should heat up the pot of water\"),to handle exceptions or adjust the plan according to the situation (\"I don't have salt, so let me use soy sauce and pepper instead\"),and to realize when external information is needed(\"how do I prepare dough? Let me search on the Internet\"). We may also act (open a cookbook to read the recipe,open the fridge,check ingredients) to support the reasoning and to answer questions (\"What dish can I make right now?\"). This tight synergy between “acting” and“reasoning” allows humans to learn new tasks quickly and perform robust decision making or reasoning, even under previously unseen circumstances or facing information uncertainties.

        "text": "Recent results have hinted at the possbility of combining verbal reasoning with interactive decision making in autonomous systems. On one hand, properly prompted large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent capabilities to carry out several steps of reasoning traces to derive answers from questions in arithmetic,commonsense,and symbolic reasoning tasks (Wei et al., 2022).However, this “chain-of-thought” reasoning is a static black box, in that the model uses its own internal representations to generate thoughts and is not grounded in the external world, which limits its ability to reason reactively or update its knowledge. This can lead to issues like fact hallucination and error propagation over the reasoning process (Figure 1 (1b)). On the other hand, recent work has explored the use of pre-trained language models for planning and acting in interactive environments (Ahn et al.,2022; Nakano et al., 2021; Yao et al., 202O; Huang et al., 2022a), with a focus on predicting actions via language priors. These approaches usually convert multi-modal observations into text, use a language model to generate domain-specific actions or plans,and then use a controller to choose or execute them. However, they do not employ language models to reason abstractly about high-level goals or maintain a working memory to support acting, barring Huang et al. (2022b) who perform a limited form of verbal reasoning to reiterate spatial facts about the current state. Beyond such simple embodied tasks to interact with afew blocks, there have not been studies on how reasoning and acting can be combined in a synergistic manner for general task solving, and if such a combination can bring systematic benefits compared to reasoning or acting alone.

The best approach overall is a combination of ReAct and CoT that allows for the use of both internal knowledge and externally obtained information during reasoning. On ALFWorld and WebShop, two or even one-shot ReAct prompting is able to outperform imitation or reinforcement learning methods trained with 103 \\~ 105 task instances, with an absolute improvement of 34% and 10% in success rates respectively. We also demonstrate the importance of sparse, versatile reasoning in decision making by showing consistent advantages over controlled baselines with actions only. Besides general applicability and performance boost, the combination of reasoning and acting also contributes to model interpretability, trustworthiness, and diagnosability across all domains,as humans can readily distinguish information from model's internal knowledge versus external environments,as wellas inspect reasoning traces to understand the decision basis of model actions.

As shown in Figure 1, there could be various types of useful thoughts, e.g.decomposing task goals and create action plans (2b, Act 1; 1d, Thought 1), injecting commonsense knowledge relevant to task solving (2b, Act 1), extracting important parts from observations (1d, Thought2, 4), track progress and transit action plans (2b,Act 8), handle exceptions and adjust action plans (1d, Thought 3),and so on.

Each in-context example is a human trajectory of actions, thoughts, and environment observations to solve a task instance (see Appendix C). For the tasks where reasoning is of primary importance (Figure 1(1)), we alternate the generation of thoughts and actions so that the task-solving trajectory consists of multiple thought-action-observation steps. In contrast, for decision making tasks that potentially involve a large number of actions (Figure 1(2)), thoughts only need to appear sparsely in the most relevant positions of a trajectory, so we let the language model decide the asynchronous occurrence of thoughts and actions for itself.

We also show in Section 3 additional benefits when finetuning is enabled,and in Section 4 how ReAct performance is robust to prompt selections.

In contrast, finetuning Standard or CoT is significantly worse than finetuning ReAct or Act for both PaLM8/62B,as the former essentially teaches models to memorize (potentially halluincated) knowledge facts,and the latter teaches models how to (reason and) act to access information from Wikipedia, a more generalizable skillfor knowledge reasoning.

It includes 6 types of tasks in which an agent needs to achieve a high-level goal (e.g.examine paper under desklamp) by navigating and interacting with a simulated household via text actions (e.g. go to coffeetable 1, take paper 2,use desklamp 1). A task instance can have more than 50 locations and take an expert policy more than 5O steps to solve, thus challenging an agent to plan and track subgoals, as well as explore systematically (e.g.check alldesks one by one for desklamp). In particular, one challenge built into ALFWorld is the need to determine likely locations for common household items (e.g. desklamps will likely be on desks,shelfs,or dressers), making this environment a good fit for LLMs to exploit their pretrained commonsense knowledge. To prompt ReAct, we randomly annotate three trajectories from the training set for each task type,where each trajectory includes sparse thoughts that (1) decompose the goal,(2) track subgoal completion,(3) determine the next subgoal,and (4) reason via commonsense where to find an object and what to do with it. We show prompts used for ALFWorld in Appendix C.4. Following Shridhar et al. (2O2Ob), we evaluate on 134 unseen evaluation games in a task-specific setup. For robustness, we construct 6 prompts for each task type through each permutation of 2 annotated trajectories from the 3 we annotate. Act prompts are constructed using the same trajectories,but without thoughts — since task instances are randomly chosen from the training set,it favors neither ReAct nor Act and provides a fair and controled comparison to test the importance of sparse thoughts. For baselines, we use BUTLER (Shridhar et al.,202Ob),an imitation learning agent trained on 1O5 expert trajectories for each task type5 . ",

However, IM's “inner monologue” is limited to observations of the environment state and what needs to be completed by the agent for the goal to be satisfied. In contrast, the reasoning traces in ReAct for decision making is flexible and sparse, allowing diverse reasoning types (see Section 2) to be induced for different tasks. ",

As can be seen in Table 3,ReAct substantially outperforms IM-style prompting (ReAct-IM) (71 vs.53 overall success rate)， with consistent advantages on five out of six tasks. Qualitatively, we observed that ReAct-IM often made mistakes in identifying when subgoals were finished,or what the next subgoal should be,due to a lack of highlevel goal decomposition. Additionally, many ReAct -IM trajectories struggled to determine where an item would likely be within the ALFWorld environment, due to a lack of commonsense reasoning. Both shortcomings can be addressed in the ReAct paradigm. More details about ReAct-IM is in Appendix B.2. An example prompt for ReAct -IM can be found in Appendix C.4,and an example trajectory in Appendix D.2.3. ",

        "text": "Language model for reasoningPerhaps the most well-known work of using LLMs for reasoning is Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al.,2022), which reveals the ability of LLMs to formulate their own “thinking procedure” for problem solving. Several follow-up works have since been performed, including least-to-most prompting for solving complicated tasks (Zhou et al.,2022),zero-shotCoT (Kojima et al., 2022), and reasoning with self-consistency (Wang et al., 2022a). Recently, (Madaan & Yazdanbakhsh, 2O22) systematically studied the formulation and structure of CoT,and observed that the presence of symbols, patterns and texts is crucial to the effectiveness of CoT. Other work has also been extended to more sophisticated reasoning architecture beyond simple prompting. For example Selection-Inference (Creswellet al., 2022) divides the reasoning process into two steps of “selection” and “inference\". STaR (Zelikman et al.,2022) bootstraps the reasoning process by finetuning the model on correct rationales generated by the model itself.Faithful reasoning (Creswell & Shanahan,2O22) decomposes multi-step reasoning into three steps, each performed by a dedicated LM respectively. Similar approaches like Scratchpad (Nye et al., 2021), which finetunes a LM on intermediate computation steps,also demonstrate improvement on multi-step computation problems. In contrast to these methods,ReAct performs more than just isolated,fixed reasoning,and integrates model actions and their corresponding observations into a coherent stream of inputs for the model to reason more accurately and tackle tasks beyond reasoning (e.g.interactive decision making).

In comparison to ReAct,WebGPT does not explicitly model the thinking and reasoning procedure, instead rely on expensive human feedback for reinforcement learning. In conversation modeling,chatbots like BlenderBot (Shuster et al.,2022b) and Sparrow (Glaese et al.,2O22) and task-oriented dialogue systems like SimpleTOD (Hosseini-Asl et al.,202O) also train LMs to make decision about API calls. Unlike ReAct, they do not explicitly consider the reasoning procedure either,and also relies on expensive datasets and human feedback collctions for policy learning. In contrast, ReAct learns a policy in a much cheaper way,since the decision making process only requires language description of the reasoning procedure.6 ",

In SayCan,LLMs were prompted to directly predict possible actions a robot can take, which is then reranked by an affordance model grounded on the visual environments for final prediction. Inner Monologue made further improvements by adding the eponymous “inner monologue\", which is implemented as injected feedback from the environment.To our knowledge, Inner Monologue is the first work that demonstrates such a closed-loop system, which ReAct builds on. However, we argue that Inner Monologue does not truly comprise of inner thoughts —this is elaborated in Section 4.We also note that leveraging language as semantically-rich inputs in the process of interactive decision making has been shown to be successful under other setings (Abramson et al.,2O2O; Karamcheti et al., 2021; Huang et al.,2022a; Li et al.,2022). It is becoming more evident that with the help of LLMs,language as a fundamental cognitive mechanism will play a critical role in interaction and decision making. What is more, progress in LLMs has also inspired the development of versatile and generalist agents like Reed et al. (2022). ",

Through a diverse set of experiments on multi-hop question-answering, fact checking, and interactive decision-making tasks, we show that ReAct leads to superior performance with interpretable decision traces. Despite the simplicity of our method, complex tasks with large action spaces require more demonstrations to learn well, which unfortunately can easily go beyond the input length limit of in-context learning. We explore the fine-tuning approach on HotpotQA with initial promising results,but learning from more high-quality human annotations will be the desiderata to further improve the performance. Scaling up ReAct with multi-task training and combining it with complementary paradigms like reinforcement learning could result in stronger agents that further unlock the potential of LLMs for more applications.

Our experiments minimize such risks by limiting the interactions to specific websites (Wikipedia or WebShop) that are free of private information, without any dangerous actions in the action space design (i.e.models cannot really buy products on WebShop the research benchmark, or edit Wikipedia).

Figure 5 shows that by simply removing a hallucinating sentence in Act 17 and adding some hints in Act 23,ReAct can be made to change its behavior drastically to align with these human thought edits and succeed in the task. From a human perspective,solving such a task becomes significantly easier, from typing tens of actions to only editing a couple of thoughts, which enables new forms of human-machine collaboration. We note that such a policy edit on-the-go is difficult for Act and previous RL methods,as a human cannot change the model parameters,and changing a few actions might not edit the rest of the model behavior. This paradigm is also more than human dialogue to update the goal or subgoal as in Huang et al. (2O22b)- while editing ReAct thoughts can do these, it can also modify the model's internal belief,reasoning styles,or anything the flexible thought space supports,for better task solving. We believe this is an exciting direction for human alignment and leave more systematic study as future work. ",
