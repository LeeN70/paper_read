This technique uses human preferences as a reward signal to fine-tune our models.We first hire a team of 4O contractors to label our data, based on their performance on a screening test (see Section 3.4 and Appendix B.1 for more details). We then collect a dataset of human-written demonstrations of the desired output behavior on (mostly English) prompts submitted to the OpenAI API³ and some labeler-written prompts, and use this to train our supervised learning baselines. Next, we collect a dataset of human-labeled comparisons between outputs from our models on a larger set of API prompts. We then train a reward model (RM) on this dataset to predict which model output our labelers would prefer. Finally, we use this RM as a reward function and fine-tune our supervised learning baseline to maximize this reward using the PPO algorithm (Schulman et al.,2O17). We ilustrate this process in Figure 2. This procedure aligns the behavior of GPT-3 to the stated preferences of a specific group of people (mostly our labelers and researchers),rather than any broader notion of “human values”；we discuss this further in Section 5.2.

We build on previous techniques to align models with human intentions,particularly reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Originally developed for training simple robots in simulated environments and Atari games (Christiano et al.,2O17; Ibarz et al., 2018), it has recently been applied to fine-tuning language models to summarize text (Ziegler et al.,2019; Stiennon et al.,202O; Bohm et al.,2019; Wu et al., 2021). This work is in turn influenced by similar work using human feedback as areward in domains such as dialogue (Jaques et al.,2019; Yi et al.,2019; Hancock et al.,2019),translation (Kreutzer et al., 2018; Bahdanau et al., 2016),semantic parsing (Lawrence and Riezler, 2O18),story generation (Zhou and Xu,2O2O),review generation (Cho et al.,2018),and evidence extraction (Perez et al., 2019). Madaan et al. (2O22) use writen human feedback to augment prompts and improve the performance of GPT-3. There has also been work on aligning agents in text-based environments using RL with a normative prior (Nahian et al., 2O21). Our work can be seen as a direct application of RLHF to aligning language models on a broad distribution of language tasks. ",

        "text": "Evaluating the harms of language models. A goal of modifying the behavior of language models is to mitigate the harms of these models when they're deployed in the real world.These risks have been extensively documented (Bender et al.,2021; Bommasani et al., 2O21; Kenton et al., 2021; Weidinger et al., 2O21; Tamkin et al.,2O21). Language models can produce biased outputs (Dhamala et al.,2021; Liang et al.,2021; Manela et al.,2021; Caliskan et al.,2017; Kirk et al.,2021), leak private data (Carlini et al.,2O21),generate misinformation (Solaiman et al.,2O19; Buchanan et al., 2021),and be used maliciously; for a thorough review we direct the reader to Weidinger et al. (2021). Deploying language models in specific domains gives rise to new risks and challenges, for example in dialog systems (Henderson et al.,2018; Xu et al.,202O; Dinan et al.,2019b). There is a nascent but growing field that aims to build benchmarks to concretely evaluate these harms, particularly around toxicity (Gehman et al., 202O), stereotypes (Nadeem et al.,202O), and social bias (Dhamala et al., 2021; Nangia et al., 202O; Rudinger et al.,2018). Making significant progress on these problems is hard since well-intentioned interventions on LM behavior can have side-effects (Welbl et al.,2021; Blodgett et al., 2O2O); for instance, efforts to reduce the toxicity of LMs can reduce their ability to model text from under-represented groups,due to prejudicial correlations in the training data (Xu et al., 2021).

        "text": "Modifying the behavior of language models to mitigate harms. There are many ways to change the generation behavior of language models. Solaiman and Dennison (2O21) fine-tune LMs on a small, value-targeted dataset, which improves the models’ ability to adhere to these values on a question answering task. Ngo et al. (2021) filter the pretraining dataset by removing documents on which a language model has a high conditional likelihood of generating a set of researcher-written trigger phrases.When trained on this filtered dataset, their LMs generate lessharmful text, at the cost of a slight decrease in language modeling performance. Xu et al. (2O2O) use a variety of approaches to improve the safety of chatbots,including data filtering, blocking certain words or n-grams during generation,safety-specific control tokens (Keskar et al.,2O19; Dinan et al.,2019a),and human-in-theloop data collection (Dinan et al.,2019b). Other approaches for mitigating the generated bias by LMs use word embedding regularization (Liu et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2O19), data augmentation (Liu et al.,2019; Dinan et al.,2019a; Sheng et al.,2019),null space projection to make the distribution over sensitive tokens more uniform (Liang et al.,2O21), diferent objective functions (Qian et al., 2019),or causal mediation analysis (Vig et al.,2020). There is also work on steering the generation of language models using a second (usually smaller) language model (Dathathri et al.,2O19; Krause et al.,202O),and variants of this idea have been applied to reducing language model toxicity (Schick et al., 2021).

However, our approach does provides us with a clear empirical feedback loop of what works and what does not.We believe that this feedback loop is essential to refine our alignment techniques, and it forces us to keep pace with progress in machine learning. Moreover,the alignment technique we use here,RLHF,is an important building block in several proposals to align superhuman systems (Leike et al., 2O18; Irving et al.,2O18; Christiano et al.,2018).For example, RLHF was a central method in recent work on summarizing books,a task that exhibits some of the difficulties of aligning superhuman AI systems as it is difficult for humans to evaluate directly (Wu et al., 2021).

Another option is for an organization to own the end-to-end infrastructure of model deployment, and make it accessible via an API.This allows for the implementation of safety protocols like use case restriction (only allowing the model to be used for certain applications), monitoring for misuse and revoking access to those who misuse the system,and rate limiting to prevent the generation of large-scale misinformation. However,this can come at the cost of reduced transparency and increased centralization of power because it requires the API provider to make decisions on where to draw the line on each of these questions.

We also noticed that the sensitivity to pretraining loss coefficient varies across tasks. Although increasing the pretraining loss coefficient causes the validation reward to drop, a single value of 27.8 seems to work well across model sizes,from 1.3B to 175B parameter count.

The pretrained GPT model is used as the KL reward model, in these experiments. We find that even by increasing the KL reward coefcient to 2.O, which is 100 times of the default value, the regressions still cannot be fixed. As expected, too large KL reward coeficient causes a significant drop in the validation reward. This result demonstrates that pretraining data distribution is critical for fixing the regressons on the public NLP datasets and maintaining the capabilities of the pretrained model. ",

The lump(s) in our chest you are describing is an example of emotional pain. Emotional pain is an uncomfortable feeling that we feelin our chest,abdomen,and other parts of our body.This feeling is often triggered by an emotional or emotional event.   \nThe goal of this article is to help you figure out what is causing the lump in your chest and how to get it to go away.   \nWhat causes the \"anxiety lumps\"?   \nThere are a number of diferent things that can cause anxiety and stress, including:   \nLack of sleep or excessive sleep   \nStress at work   \nStress at home   \nOngoing or unresolved conflict in relationships   \nTraumatic life events,such as car accidents or other accidents   \nFinancial problems (e.g. losing your job,spending too much money)   \nMedical conditions (e.g. high blood pressure)   \nDrugs and alcohol   \nWhat happens in the body?   \nThe reason that you feel the lump in your chest is because your body is preparing for a fight-or-flight response. When you feel threatened, your body is preparing to either fight the threat (e.g.run away) or to confront the threat (e.g. stand your ground).   \n[.] ",
